## Self-Serve Plan Management

Customers on our self-serve plans can now manage and pay for their Zuplo play in
the Zuplo portal. Payment and plan management powered by Stripe

## Developer Environment Improvements

We have migrated developer environments (i.e. working copy) to a new hosting
platform. This will increase the reliability of development environments
(although they are still not a substitute for edge deployed environments and
should only be used for development and testing purposes)

## Self-Serve Account Members

Account members can now be fully managed in the Zuplo portal. Add or remove
users from your account in just a few clicks.

## Dev Portal API Key Analytics

Users of the Zuplo Developer Portal can now see analytics for their own API key
usage.
