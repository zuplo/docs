### Secure Tunnel Management

[Secure Tunnels](/docs/articles/secure-tunnel) can now be managed using the

### String interpolated environment variables

When using environment variables in with string interpolation in `routes.json`
or your OpenAPI file, i.e. `"option": "my-$env(ENV_VAR)-value"` `undefined`
environment variables would result in the string "undefined" (Javascript's
result of `${undefined}`). Instead undefined variables will now result in an
empty string.
