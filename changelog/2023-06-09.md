## Request Body Validation Policy

The new
[Request Body Validation policy](https://zuplo.com/docs/policies/request-validation-inbound)
allows validating incoming request bodies based on the schema in your OpenAPI
file. This policy can be configured to reject requests with invalid body schemas
or write logs to your preferred logging provider.

## Mock API Response Policy

The [Mock API Response policy](https://zuplo.com/docs/policies/mock-api-inbound)
enables rapid mocking of an API using the examples inside of your OpenAPI
document. Return a single example or random examples to build a proof-of-concept
for your API or enable clients to begin development while the backend is being
built out.

## Firebase Upstream Authentication Policies

Proxy data or services from Firestore through Zuplo using two new policies.

- [Upstream Firebase Admin Auth](https://zuplo.com/docs/policies/upstream-firebase-admin-auth-inbound) -
  authorizes requests using a Firebase Admin Token that can be used to call any
  Firebase API.
- [Upstream Firebase User Auth](https://zuplo.com/docs/policies/upstream-firebase-user-auth-inbound) -
  authorizes requests as a specific user which allows securing Firebase
  resources using
  [security rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules/rules-and-auth)

## API Analytics

Enterprise customers can now access rich analytics through the Analytics tab in
the dashboard. Analytics make it easy to view:

- Requests by response status
- Top Users
- Users who hit rate limits
- Request latency

## Portal Improvements

Over the past few weeks we have shipped a number of improvements to the portal
including:

- A new test running right in the Route designer
- A project info page in the settings tab
- Performance improvements when editing large OpenAPI files
- Subfolder support in the modules directory
