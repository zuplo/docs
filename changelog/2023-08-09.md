## Improved Github Integration

The Zuplo Github integration has been reworked to improve reliability and
performance. You can now connect to Github with scoped authentication that
allows you to only grant Zuplo access to a single repository. Multiple Github
Orgs and Repos can be connected.

See the [documentation](https://zuplo.com/docs/articles/github-source-control)
for details
