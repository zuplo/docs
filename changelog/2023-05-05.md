## Account API Keys

API Keys for your Zuplo account can be created from the Zuplo Portal. These keys
are used with the Zuplo CLI or the Zuplo Developer API.

## Open API Handler

The new Open API handler allows serving the public version of your OpenAPI file
through a route of your choice.

## Open API from ZuploContext (Alpha)

The `context.route` property on the
[`ZuploContext`](https://zuplo.com/docs/articles/zuplo-context) object now
exposes the raw Open API operation JSON for use in handlers or policies.

```ts
export async function myHandler(request: ZuploRequest, context: ZuploContext) {
  const raw = context.route.raw();
  return raw;
}
```

## Additional Geolocation Properties

The `incomingRequestProperties` property on the
[`ZuploContext`](https://zuplo.com/docs/articles/zuplo-context) route now
exposes several additional values:

- `postalCode` - Postal code of the incoming request, for example, "78701".
- `metroCode` - Metro code (DMA) of the incoming request, for example, "635".
- `region` - If known, the ISO 3166-2 name for the first level region associated
  with the IP address of the incoming request, for example, "Texas".
- `regionCode` - If known, the ISO 3166-2 code for the first-level region
  associated with the IP address of the incoming request, for example, "TX".
- `timezone` - Timezone of the incoming request, for example, "America/Chicago".

## Improved Policy Usage Visibility

The `policy.json` editor in the Zuplo Portal now shows when a policy is used
inside of a
[composite policy](https://zuplo.com/docs/policies/composite-inbound).
