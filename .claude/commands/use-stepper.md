Change the tutorial to use the Stepper react component. This is done by
reformatting the headings that start with a number and wrapping them in the
stepper.

For any markdown admonitions, ensure that the start and end blocks (i.e.
`:::tip` and `:::`) have a line break before and after so that code formatting
works.

Change the headings to use `1. **Heading**` format instead of ##

Make sure to indent four spaces the content inside the bullet points so that the
markdown is formatted correctly.
