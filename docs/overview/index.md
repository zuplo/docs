# Getting Started

Zuplo is an API Management platform designed for developers. It's **different** because it:

1. **Is Programmable** - code your own handlers and policies in typescript.
2. **Uses Gitops** - integrates with GitHub and deploys via gitops (like Vercel and Netlify).
3. **Respects your toolset** - use Visual Studio, Sublime, whatever IDE you like, or our [web portal](https://portal.zuplo.com/signup).
4. **Offers infinite scale at the edge** - scales effortlessly to billions of requests, deploy to the edge at over 200 locations around the world with 0ms startup time.

## Instant API Docs and Developer Portal

Import your Open API spec or set up a few routes and you’ll have an instant developer portal ready for your API consumers. Follow [this guide](../quickstarts/add-api-key-auth.md) to get it working in 2 minutes. **[Open Quickstart ➡️](../quickstarts/instant-api-docs-and-dev-portal.md)**

## Add API-Key Authentication to any API

We [recommend API key authentication](/blog/2022/05/03/you-should-be-using-api-keys/) in most API sharing scenarios, but there’s a lot to implement to use API keys successfully. Let us take away all the pain. Follow [this guide](../quickstarts/add-api-key-auth.md) to get it working in less than 5 minutes. **[Open Quickstart ➡️](../quickstarts/add-api-key-auth.md)**

## API Request Validation with JSON Schema

Quickly set up a gateway for an API and add validation using JSON Schema with [this guide](../quickstarts/validation-and-docs-with-json-schema.md). **[Open Quickstart ➡️](../quickstarts/validation-and-docs-with-json-schema.md)**

## Dynamic Rate Limiting

The [API Gateway Quickstart](../quickstarts/proxy-public-api.md) quick start shows how to configure [rate limiting](../policies/rate-limit-inbound.md) for a route. A default rate limit policy is a great way to protect your API, but sometimes you need more control. In [this quickstart](../quickstarts/per-customer-rate-limits.md), you will learn how to set a custom rate limit policy for a single customer based on a route parameter. **[Open Quickstart ➡️](../quickstarts/per-customer-rate-limits.md)**
