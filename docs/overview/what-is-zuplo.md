title: What is Zuplo?
---

At its core, Zuplo is a highly customizable API Gateway that makes it easy for developers to expand the capabilities of their API. More specifically, Zuplo is the easiest way for developers to share their APIs. Zuplo provides a host of services that allow you to add authentication, observability, and control to
your API so that you can safely share it with customers, partners, and other developers.

You probably have an API today that you use internally. As your business grows, you might need to let partners access parts of your API. What are your options? Well, you could certainly write a bunch of code to add new security capabilities, new monitoring/logging, new metering, new... you get the idea. Another option is to enhance your API with Zuplo and start onboarding your customers, partners, and developers in no time.

Zuplo Makes it easy for you to add:

- API Key Authentication
- API Key Management
- A Developer Portal for your user's to manage their Keys
- Automatic API Documentation (import your OpenAPI spec if you have one)
- Add rate limiting and other policies to enforce access compliance
- And much more

Zuplo is extremely fast, it is easy to set up, and it is fully customizable with
both configuration and code.
