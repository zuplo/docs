title: Using Policies
---

Policies are modules that can intercept an incoming request. You can have
multiple policies and apply them to multiple routes. There are built-in policies
but of course, being a developer-focused platform you can easily create custom
policies.

[To learn more about policies see the reference docs.](../policies/index.md)
