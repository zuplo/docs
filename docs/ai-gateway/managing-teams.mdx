Teams in the Zuplo AI Gateway are how users are granted access to AI Providers
and Apps. Teams are hierarchical with access propagating downward. Teams are
also where you define usage limits.

## Creating a Team

   [Zuplo Portal](https://portal.zuplo.com).

1. Click on the **Create Team** button.

## Adding Team Members

Team members are the users who belong to a team and can access the AI Providers
and Apps associated with that team.

   [Zuplo Portal](https://portal.zuplo.com).

1. Type the email address of the user you want to add. If the user is already a

   don't have an account, they will be invited to join the account and then
   added to the team.

   roles are:
   - **Member**: Can access AI Providers and Apps assigned to the team.

     Apps assigned to the team.
