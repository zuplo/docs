Zuplo's AI Gateway supports the addition of custom AI providers. This allows
users to route their AI Gateway Apps to self hosted services and models,
providing an additional layer of control, security and governance when using
these models in production.

Please note that currently only OpenAI-compatible models are supported using
custom providers

   project in the [Zuplo Portal](https://portal.zuplo.com).

1. Click on the **Add Provider** button.

1. Select the **Custom** option from the Custom Providers section of the list

1. Specify a label for the custom provider instance. You can change the label
   later if required.

   you can leave this blank).
