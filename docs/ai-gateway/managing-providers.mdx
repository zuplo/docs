Zuplo's AI Gateway supports integration with various
[AI providers](./providers.mdx), allowing you to leverage different models and
services for your AI applications.

## Adding a New AI Provider

To add a new AI provider to your Zuplo AI Gateway, follow these steps:

<Stepper>

1. Navigate to the **Settings** > **AI Providers** section of your AI Gateway
   project in the [Zuplo Portal](https://portal.zuplo.com).

1. Click on the **Add Provider** button.

1. Select the desired provider from the list of
   [supported providers](./providers.mdx).

1. Specify a label for the provider instance to easily identify it later. You
   can change the label later if required.

1. Enter the API Key for the selected provider. For instructions on how to
   create an API key for each provider see the
   [provider documentation](./providers.mdx).

1. Select the model or models you want to use with this provider. The available
   models will depend on the selected provider. This can be changed later.

## Editing an AI Provider

Existing providers can be modified by navigating to the **Settings** > **AI
Providers** section and clicking the **Edit** button next to the provider you
want to modify.

You can modify the label, API key, and selected models for the provider. After
making your changes, click **Save** to apply them. Changes are effective
immediately.

:::caution

Be careful removing models from an provider that is in use as it may break
existing applications that rely on the provider.

## Deleting an AI Provider

Providers that are no longer used within your project can be deleted. To delete
a provider, navigate to the **Settings** > **AI Providers** section and click
the **Delete** button next to the provider you want to remove.
