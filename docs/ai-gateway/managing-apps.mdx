title: Managing Apps

Apps in the AI Gateway represent any app or integration that will call the AI
Gateway. For example, you might have a custom support chatbot on your website -
that chatbot would be an App in the AI Gateway. Each App has its own API Key so
that usage is tracked independently. Apps are owned by a specific
[team](./teams.mdx) and can access the AI Providers assigned to that team.
