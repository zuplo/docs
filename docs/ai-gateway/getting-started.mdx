This guide will walk you through setting up your first AI Gateway project, from
initial configuration to making your first LLM request through Zuplo.

## Prerequisites

- A Zuplo account (sign up free at [zuplo.com](https://zuplo.com))
- API keys for at least one LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini,
  etc.)
- An application that needs to call LLM APIs

## Step 1: Create an AI Gateway Project

1. Log into your Zuplo account
2. Click **Create New Project**
3. Select the **AI Gateway** template
4. Give your project a name (for example, "MyCompany AI Gateway")
5. Click **Create Project**

Your AI Gateway project will be created in seconds. You'll notice the interface
includes Apps, Teams, and a setup guide to help you get started.

## Step 2: Configure Providers

Providers are the LLM services (like OpenAI or Google Gemini) that your
applications will use. You'll configure these once as an administrator, and your
team members can use them without needing direct access to provider API keys.

### Adding Your First Provider

1. Click **Add Provider**
2. Select your AI provider (for example, **OpenAI**)
3. Enter a name for this provider configuration
4. Paste your provider's API key
5. Select which models you want to make available to your teams
6. Click **Create**

### Adding Additional Providers

Repeat the process above to add more providers. This allows your teams to switch
between providers (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.) without changing application code.

**Example providers you might add:**

- OpenAI (for GPT models)
- Google Gemini (for Gemini models)
- Additional providers as they become available

## Step 3: Create a Team

Teams allow you to organize users and set hierarchical budget controls. Even if
you're starting solo, you'll need at least one team.

### Creating Your Root Team

1. Click **Create Team**
2. Name your team (for example, "Root" or your company name)
3. Choose an icon for easy identification
4. Set organization-wide limits (optional) by clicking on **Settings**:
   - **Daily Budget**: Maximum spend per day (for example, $1,000)
   - **Rate Limits**: Request limits if needed
5. Click **Create**

### Creating Sub-Teams (Optional)

For larger organizations, create sub-teams with their own budgets:

1. From your root team, click **Create Sub-Team**
2. Name the team (for example, "Engineering Team", "Credit Team")
3. Choose an icon
4. Set team-specific limits by clicking on **Settings**:
   - Daily budgets that are equal to or less than the parent team's limit
   - Example: If root is $1,000/day, a sub-team might be $500/day
5. Click **Save Changes**

## Step 4: Create Applications

Applications represent individual projects or services that will use the AI
Gateway. Each app gets its own unique URL and API key.

### Creating Your First App

1. Click **Apps** followed by **Create App**
2. Configure your app:
   - **App Name**: Descriptive name (for example, "Tennis Chat", "Customer
     Support Bot")
   - **Team**: Select which team owns this app
   - **Provider**: Choose your LLM provider (for example, OpenAI)
   - **Model**: Select the specific model (for example, GPT-4o) for completions
     and/or embeddings
3. Set application-level budgets:
   - **Daily Limit**: (for example, $1/day for a hackathon project)
   - **Monthly Limit**: (for example, $10/month)
4. Enable **Semantic Caching** (optional):
   - Caches similar prompts to reduce costs and improve performance
   - Best for applications with repeated queries
5. Click **Create**

### Access Your App Credentials

After creating your application, you'll see:

- **API Key**: Your Zuplo-managed key. You'll need them to integrate with your
  application.

## Step 5: Integrate with Your Application

Now you'll update your application to use the Zuplo AI Gateway instead of
calling LLM providers directly.

In the examples below, we assume that you are using the official
[Node.js OpenAI SDK](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries/node-js-library)
and that you have executed `npm install openai`.

### Before: Direct Provider Integration (sample.mjs)

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

// Old approach - directly calling OpenAI
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }],
});

console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);
```

### After: Using Zuplo AI Gateway (sample.mjs)

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

// New approach - using Zuplo AI Gateway
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.ZUPLO_API_KEY,
  baseURL: "https://your-ai-gateway-url.zuplo.app/v1",
});

const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }],
});

console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);
```

Run the example with `node sample.mjs`.

### What Changed?

1. **URL**: Replace your provider's URL with your Zuplo Gateway URL
2. **API Key**: Use your Zuplo API key instead of the provider's key
3. **Everything else stays the same**: The request format remains compatible
   with OpenAI's API

## Verify Your Setup

### Make Your First Request

Send a test request through your gateway:

```bash
curl https://your-ai-gateway-url.zuplo.app/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ZUPLO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world!"}]
  }'
```

### Check Your Dashboard

1. Return to your AI Gateway project
2. Click on your app
3. Click on **Dashboard** to view:
   - Request count
   - Token usage
   - Time to first byte
   - Current spending

You should see your test request appear with token usage and performance
metrics.

## Next Steps

Now that your AI Gateway is running, explore additional features:

### Switch Providers Without Code Changes

1. Go to your app settings
2. Change the **Provider** dropdown (for example, from OpenAI to Gemini)
3. Select a new model
4. Click **Save CHanges**

Your application will now use the new provider without any code changes.

## Common Issues

**Issue**: "Authentication failed" error

- **Solution**: Verify you're using your Zuplo API key, not your provider's key

**Issue**: Budget limit reached immediately

- **Solution**: Check that sub-team limits don't exceed available budget from
  parent team

**Issue**: Semantic caching not working

- **Solution**: Ensure caching is enabled in your application settings and
  prompts are similar enough to match
