The [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) is a free open-source library that gives you
the tools you need to build AI-powered products. It is compatible with a large
selection of providers and models, and has a large selection of additional
community supported providers being added regularly.

## Prerequisites

In order to use the AI Gateway with any AI SDK powered application you will need
to complete these steps first:

<Stepper>

1. Create a [new provider](/ai-gateway/managing-providers) in the AI Gateway for
   the provider you want to use with AI SDK

2. [Set up a new team](/ai-gateway/managing-teams)

3. Create a [new app](/ai-gateway/managing-apps) to use specifically with AI SDK
   and assign it to the team you created

4. Copy the API Key for the app you created, as well as the Gateway URL

</Stepper>

## Configure the AI SDK

To route all AI SDK requests through Zuplo instead of directly to the API of the
chosen provider, you must set the API `baseUrl` in the SDK configuration to
point to the Gateway URL of your Zuplo AI Gateway.

Additionally, you will need to change the value of `apiKey` to the API key of
the app you have configured in Zuplo.

### OpenAI

import { createOpenAI } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { generateText } from "ai";

const openai = createOpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.ZUPLO_AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY,
  baseURL: "https://my-ai-gateway.zuplo.app/v1",
});

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai.chat("gpt-4o"),
  prompt: "Write a one-sentence bedtime story about a unicorn.",

  // Authorization header is also required
  headers: {
    "Authorization": `Bearer ${process.env.ZUPLO_AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY}`
  }
});

const { text } = await generateText({
