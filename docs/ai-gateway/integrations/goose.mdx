[goose](https://block.github.io/goose/) is an local AI agent and CLI tool for
automating engineering tasks. It's completely
[open-source](https://github.com/block/goose) with no vendor lock-in, supports
local LLMs, has extensive MCP (Model Context Protocol) support, and offers
powerful extensibility through recipes.

## Prerequisites

In order to use the AI Gateway with goose you will need to complete these steps
first:

<Stepper>

1. Create a [new provider](/ai-gateway/managing-providers) in the AI Gateway for
   the provider you want to use with goose

2. [Set up a new team](/ai-gateway/managing-teams)

3. Create a [new app](/ai-gateway/managing-apps) to use specifically with goose
   and assign it to the team you created

4. Copy the API Key for the app you created, as well as the Gateway URL

</Stepper>

## Configure goose

Because goose can be run as a standalone desktop app and a CLI there are two
configuration approaches depending on which version you choose.

### CLI

<Stepper>

1. Run `goose configure`

2. Select **Configure Providers** from the menu

3. Choose **OpenAI** as the provider you want to add (this will work for any
   OpenAI compatible provider and model)

4. Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` to the API Key for the app you created for goose in
   Zuplo

5. Set the `OPENAI_HOST` to the URL of your AI Gateway using the Gateway URL
   from your project

6. The `OPENAI_BASE_PATH` may already be configured. If it is not, enter
   `v1/chat/completions` as the value

7. Enter the model you want to use with goose.

</Stepper>

:::note

The provider model you want to use with goose must be selected in the provider
you created in the Prerequisites step above

:::

After completing the steps, goose will check the configuration. If all is well
it will save the configuration and you are ready to start working with goose via
the AI Gateway.

### Desktop App

If you are using the goose desktop application you can add a Custom Provider for
AI Gateway by following these steps:

<Stepper>

1. Open the goose desktop application

2. Click on **Settings**

3. Click on **Configure Providers** to open the Provider settings

4. Click on **Add Custom Provider**

5. Choose a **Provider Type** (both OpenAI Compatible and Anthropic compatible
   will work)

6. Enter a **Display Name** (eg. Zuplo AI Gateway)

7. Set the **API URL** to the URL of your Zuplo AI Gateway

8. Set the **API Key** to the API key of the app you created for goose in Zuplo

9. Set the list of **Available Models** to the same list you selected when you
   set up the provider in the Prerequisites step (eg. gpt-4o, gpt-5, gpt-5-nano)

10. Click on **Create Provider**

</Stepper>

The Zuplo AI Gateway and associated provider and model(s) will now be available
to use with the goose desktop application.
