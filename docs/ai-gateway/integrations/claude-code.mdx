The Zuplo AI Gateway supports the [Anthropic](https://docs.claude.com/en/home)
`/v1/messages` API endpoint. This means that you can configure
[Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code) to work seamlessly via
the AI Gateway.

## Why Route Claude Code Through Zuplo?

Instead of sharing API keys across your team or worrying about budget overruns,
the Zuplo AI Gateway gives you:

- **Team-Based Access Control** - Create teams with self-serve API key
  generation, so developers can securely access Claude Code without sharing
  credentials.

- **Hierarchical Cost Controls** - Set monthly spending limits per application
  or project to prevent budget surprises during hackathons or development
  sprints.

- **Complete Visibility** - Monitor request volume, token usage, costs, and
  performance metrics through a comprehensive dashboard.

- **Security at Scale** - Eliminate API key sprawl and reduce the risk of
  compromised shared keys.

## Claude Code Setup

<Stepper>
1. Create a [new provider](/ai-gateway/managing-providers) in the AI Gateway for Anthropic

2. [Set up a new team](/ai-gateway/managing-teams)

3. Create a [new app](/ai-gateway/managing-apps) to use with Claude Code and
   assign it to the team you created

4. Copy the API Key for the app you created, as well as the Gateway URL

5. Add the API key and Gateway URL to your environment, or Claude Code settings,
   using either approach below
   </Stepper>

### Environment

```
ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=<your-ai-gateway-app-api-key>
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=<your-ai-gateway-url>
```

### Using settings.json

```json
{
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "<your-ai-gateway-app-api-key>",
    "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "<your-ai-gateway-url>"
  }
}
```

Restart Claude and it will switch to using your new AI Gatway configuration and
all your Claude Code LLM requests will route through the AI Gateway.
