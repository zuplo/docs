The Zuplo AI Gateway supports the [Anthropic](https://docs.claude.com/en/home)
`/v1/messages` API endpoint. This means that you can configure
[Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code) to work seamlessly via
the AI Gateway.

## Claude Code Setup

<Stepper>

1. Create a [new provider](/ai-gateway/managing-providers) in the AI Gateway for
   Anthropic

2. [Set up a new team](/ai-gateway/managing-teams)

3. Create a [new app](/ai-gateway/managing-apps) to use with Claude Code and
   assign it to the team you created

4. Copy the API Key for the app you created, as well as the Gateway URL

5. Add the API key and Gateway URL to your environment, or Claude Code settings,
   using either approach below

</Stepper>

### Environment

```
ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=<your-ai-gateway-app-api-key>
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=<your-ai-gateway-url>
```

### Using settings.json

```json
{
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "<your-ai-gateway-app-api-key>",
    "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "<your-ai-gateway-url>"
  }
}
```

Restart Claude and it will switch to using your new AI Gateway configuration and
all your Claude Code LLM requests will route through the AI Gateway.
