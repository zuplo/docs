Teams are used to manage access to AI Gateway applications, set usage limits,
and monitor activity. Each team can have multiple members and sub-teams. Use
teams to group users by department, project, or any other logical grouping.

## Teams & Apps

Apps in the AI Gateway represent any app or integration that will call the AI
Gateway. Apps in the AI Gateway are owned by a specific team. Members of the
team will have permissions to perform various actions on the App dependin on
their permissions.

## Members

Members are the users who belong to a team. The permission of a member will
depend on their role in the Zuplo account, project, and team.

There are two roles at the team level:

- **Member**: Can access AI Providers and Apps assigned to the team.
- **Admin**: Can manage team settings, members, and access AI Providers and Apps
  assigned to the team.

For more information on roles and permissions, see the
[document on roles and permissions](../articles/accounts/roles-and-permissions.mdx).
