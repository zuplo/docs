The Akamai AI Firewall policy integrates
[Akamai Firewall for AI](https://www.akamai.com/products/firewall-for-ai) with
the Zuplo AI Gateway, providing enterprise-grade security for AI-powered
applications, large language models (LLMs), and AI-driven APIs.

The Akamai AI Firewall policy secures both inbound AI queries and outbound AI
responses, protecting against emerging cyber threats specific to generative AI
applications. By analyzing AI interactions in real-time, the policy detects and
mitigates AI-specific vulnerabilities that traditional security tools can't
address.

### Key Security Capabilities

The Akamai AI Firewall provides comprehensive protection against AI-specific
threats:

- **Prompt injection defense**: Protects against attackers manipulating AI
  models through deceptive inputs
- **Data loss prevention (DLP)**: Detects and blocks sensitive data leaks in
  AI-generated responses and incoming requests
- **Toxic and harmful content filtering**: Flags hate speech, misinformation,
  and offensive content before delivery
- **Adversarial AI security**: Protects against remote code execution, model
  back doors, and data poisoning attacks
- **Denial-of-service mitigation**: Controls excessive query usage and model
  overload

## Benefits with Zuplo AI Gateway

Integrating Akamai AI Firewall with the Zuplo AI Gateway provides several
advantages:

### Unified Security Posture

Standardized AI security across your entire infrastructure, whether deployed at
the edge, in the cloud, hybrid, or on-premises environments.

### Automated Threat Detection

AI-specific protections work automatically without manual rule tuning,
leveraging Akamai's global threat intelligence to continuously adapt to emerging
threats.

### Seamless WAAP Integration

Extends web application and API protection (WAAP) capabilities with AI-specific
defenses, providing comprehensive security for your API gateway.

### Compliance and Governance

Helps meet security and compliance standards including data privacy regulations,
ethical AI usage requirements, and corporate governance mandates through
detailed audit logs and real-time security analytics.

### Zero Performance Impact

The policy operates inline with minimal latency, preserving application
performance while providing enterprise-grade security.

## How It Works

### AI Traffic Analysis

The policy monitors and analyzes AI interactions by inspecting:

1. **Incoming user prompts**: Analyzed before reaching the AI model
2. **AI-generated outputs**: Inspected before delivery to end users

This dual-layer inspection prevents security risks while maintaining
performance.

### Risk Scoring

AI interactions are evaluated against multiple security indicators, including:

- Prompt injection attempts
- Sensitive data exposure
- Adversarial exploits
- Toxic content patterns
- Abnormal query patterns

### Security Enforcement Actions

Based on risk scores and configured policies, the firewall takes one of three
actions:

- **Monitor**: Logs detected threats for analysis without interfering with AI
  queries or responses
- **Modify**: Adjusts AI-generated outputs inline, removing or altering unsafe
  content while maintaining natural conversation flow
- **Deny**: Blocks high-risk inputs from reaching the AI model and prevents
  unsafe responses from being returned to users

## Use Cases

### Protecting Customer-Facing AI Chatbots

Secure AI-powered customer service applications from prompt injection attacks
and ensure responses don't leak sensitive customer data or generate toxic
content.

### Safeguarding Internal AI Tools

Protect internal AI assistants and copilots from adversarial exploits while
preventing unauthorized access to proprietary information.

### Regulatory Compliance

Maintain compliance with data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) by
automatically detecting and blocking sensitive data leaks in AI interactions.

### API Security for AI Services

Extend your API security posture to cover AI-specific threats that traditional
API gateways can't detect.
