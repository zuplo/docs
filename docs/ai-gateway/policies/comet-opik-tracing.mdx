The Comet Opik Tracing policy integrates
[Comet Opik](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/) with the Zuplo AI Gateway,
enabling comprehensive observability, tracing, and evaluation of your LLM
applications in both development and production environments.

Comet Opik is an open-source platform designed to help developers track, view,
and evaluate Large Language Model (LLM) traces throughout the application
lifecycle. By integrating Opik with the Zuplo AI Gateway, you gain complete
visibility into your AI operations, from development debugging to production
monitoring.

### Key Capabilities

The Comet Opik integration provides powerful observability and evaluation
features:

- **Comprehensive trace logging** — Automatically capture LLM calls, inputs,
  outputs, and metadata
- **Development debugging** — Annotate and label traces through SDK or UI for
  iterative improvement
- **LLM evaluation** — Use LLM-as-a-Judge and heuristic evaluators to score
  trace quality
- **Production monitoring** — Track feedback scores, trace counts, tokens, and
  performance metrics at scale
- **High-volume ingestion** — Support for up to 40 million traces per day
- **Dataset management** — Store and run evaluations on test datasets

## Benefits with Zuplo AI Gateway

Integrating Comet Opik with the Zuplo AI Gateway provides several advantages:

### Complete Application Observability

Track entire LLM workflows including preprocessing, retrieval steps, model
calls, and post-processing through your API gateway, providing end-to-end
visibility.

### Development and Production Parity

Use the same tracing infrastructure in both development and production
environments, ensuring consistent observability throughout your application
lifecycle.

### Automatic Trace Capture

The policy automatically logs all AI Gateway requests and responses without
requiring code changes to your LLM application, simplifying instrumentation.

### Performance Insights

Monitor token usage, latency, error rates, and costs across all your AI
operations with detailed analytics dashboards.

### Quality Assurance

Evaluate LLM outputs using both automated metrics and LLM-as-a-Judge approaches
to maintain quality standards as your application evolves.

## How It Works

### Trace Logging

The policy captures comprehensive information about each LLM interaction:

1. **Request data** — User prompts, input parameters, and metadata
2. **Response data** — Model outputs, token counts, and generation details
3. **Performance metrics** — Latency, processing time, and resource usage
4. **Custom metadata** — Tags, conversation IDs, and application-specific data

### Trace Organization

Traces are organized hierarchically to represent complex workflows:

- **Traces** — Top-level records representing complete user interactions
- **Spans** — Nested operations within a trace (retrieval, generation, etc.)
- **Thread IDs** — Group related traces by conversation or session

### Evaluation Framework

Opik provides multiple evaluation approaches:

#### Heuristic Metrics

Deterministic evaluation methods including:

- **Exact match** — Verify outputs match expected values
- **Contains** — Check for presence of specific content
- **Regex patterns** — Validate output structure and format

#### LLM-as-a-Judge Metrics

AI-powered evaluation for subjective quality assessment:

- **Hallucination detection** — Identify factually incorrect outputs
- **Relevance scoring** — Measure response appropriateness
- **Tone and style** — Evaluate alignment with brand guidelines
- **Safety checks** — Detect harmful or inappropriate content

## Use Cases

### Debugging LLM Applications

Identify and fix issues in LLM applications by examining detailed trace logs,
including inputs, outputs, and intermediate steps.

### A/B Testing AI Models

Compare performance across different models, prompts, or configurations by
analyzing traces grouped by experiment variants.

### Cost Optimization

Monitor token usage patterns to identify optimization opportunities and reduce
AI operation costs.

### Compliance and Auditing

Maintain detailed audit logs of all AI interactions for regulatory compliance
and security requirements.

### Quality Regression Testing

Track LLM output quality over time using automated evaluations, catching
degradation before it impacts users.

### Conversation Analytics

Analyze multi-turn conversations using thread IDs to understand user journeys
and improve conversational AI experiences.
