## Redundancy and Failover

### Public Cloud

The public cloud version of the Zuplo gateway services runs in more than 200 edge locations. Failures are instantly and transparently routed to avoid customer impact.

### Private Cloud

Private cloud deployments can run in one or multiple data centers of your choosing. Multiple instances of the gateway services run at each location ensuring high availability.

## Data residency

While Zuplo is primarily a stateless proxy between your customers and your backend service, there can be cases where data is cached or stored. The default deployment model for the public cloud does not have any data residency guarantees.

For enterprise customers on both public cloud and private cloud deployments, custom data residency options are available.

## Isolation

Customers on public cloud deployments are isolated from one another through multiple layers of security. However, to meet the most strict security and compliance requirements full isolation may be required and is offered through our private cloud deployments.
