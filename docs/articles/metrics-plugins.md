title: Metrics Plugins
---

An essential part of any application is the ability to continuously monitor its
performance in production to detect any issues. Zuplo provides support for
sending metrics to a variety of services. If you want your logs to be sent to
your metrics service, you can enable one of Zuplo's logging plugins. Currently,
Zuplo supports logging to the following sources:

- Datadog (Beta)
- Dynatrace (Beta)

If you would like to log to a different source, reach out to support@zuplo.com
and we'd be happy to work with you to add a new logging plugin.

To configure your logging, you must create a `zuplo.runtime.ts` file in the
`modules`. The examples below show the content of the file with each of the
different logging plugins.

<EnterpriseFeature name="Custom metrics" />

## Metrics

Zuplo supports the following metrics:

- request latency
  - This measures the the total time (in milliseconds) that a request takes once
    it has entered the API Gateway. It includes any outbounds calls from the
    gateway.
- request content length
  - The content length of the request as reported by the content-length header.
    May be omitted if the content-length header is not present.
- response content length.
  - The content length of the response as reported by the content-length header.
    May be omitted if the content-length header is not present.

## Plugins

Below, you will find details on each metrics plugin.

### Datadog (Beta)

By default, we send all metrics to Datadog. However, you have the option below
to configure which metrics you want to send.

Due to the pricing model of Datadog, we recommend being thrifty with what is
being sent. Refer to
[counting custom metrics](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/billing/custom_metrics/?tab=countrate#counting-custom-metrics)
for more information. In general, try to avoid high-dimensionality/cardinality
tags since those are counted as separate metrics. This
[article by Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/the-power-of-tagged-metrics/)
has some good guidelines.

As of October 2023, we are in the process of becoming an official integration
with Datadog, which would reduce the way some of our metrics are counted.

```ts
import {
  RuntimeExtensions,
  DataDogMetricsPlugin,
  environment,
} from "@zuplo/runtime";

export function runtimeInit(runtime: RuntimeExtensions) {
  runtime.addPlugin(
    new DataDogMetricsPlugin({
      apiKey: environment.DATADOG_API_KEY,
      // You can add what tags you want.
      // See https://docs.datadoghq.com/tagging/#defining-tags for more information
      tags: [
        "app:my-service-name",
        `environment:${environment.ENVIRONMENT ?? "DEVELOPMENT"}`,
      ],
      metrics: {
        latency: true,
        requestContentLength: true,
        responseContentLength: true,
      },
      // You can also choose to add additional tags to include in the metrics.
      // Be mindful of what other information you wish to include since it will incur costs on your cardinality
      include: {
        country: false,
        method: false,
        statusCode: false,
      },
    }),
  );
}
```

The above configuration applies globally for all metrics send to Datadog. If you
wish to dynamically configure information for a particular ZuploContext, you can
use the `DataDogMetricsPlugin` in your code. Currently, the only configuration
you can set is the tags. The values you set here will be appended to those set
globally in the `zuplo.runtime.ts` file.

```ts
import {
  ZuploContext,
  ZuploRequest,
  DataDogMetricsPlugin,
} from "@zuplo/runtime";

export default async function (request: ZuploRequest, context: ZuploContext) {
  const someValue = "hello";
  DataDogMetricsPlugin.setContext(context, {
    tags: [`my-custom-tag:${someValue}`],
  });

  return "What zup?";
}
```

### Dynatrace (Beta)

By default, we send all metrics to Dynatrace. However, you have the option below
to configure which metrics you want to send.

:::warning Strict format

Dynatrace has a strict format for its payload, which has some _surprising_
requirements.

From
https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/extend-dynatrace/extend-metrics/reference/metric-ingestion-protocol#dimension

> Allowed characters for the key are lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens (-),
> periods (.), and underscores (\_). Special letters (like รถ) are not allowed.

The _surprising_ part is that uppercase characters are **not** allowed.

Do be mindful when you are crafting your own dimensions since an invalid
property will cause the entire payload to be rejected.

```ts
import {
  RuntimeExtensions,
  DynatraceMetricsPlugin,
  environment,
} from "@zuplo/runtime";

export function runtimeInit(runtime: RuntimeExtensions) {
  runtime.addPlugin(
    new DynatraceMetricsPlugin({
      // You can find the documentation on how to get your URL at
      // https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/dynatrace-api/environment-api/metric-v2/post-ingest-metrics#example
      url: "https://demo.live.dynatrace.com/api/v2/metrics/ingest",
      apiToken: environment.DYNATRACE_API_TOKEN,
      // Dimensions should conform to Dynatrace ingest protocol
      // See https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/extend-dynatrace/extend-metrics/reference/metric-ingestion-protocol
      dimensions: [
        'app="my-service-name"',
        `environment="${environment.ENVIRONMENT ?? "DEVELOPMENT"}"`,
      ],
      metrics: {
        latency: true,
        requestContentLength: true,
        responseContentLength: true,
      },
      // You can also choose to add additional tags to include in the metrics.
      include: {
        country: false,
        method: false,
        statusCode: false,
      },
    }),
  );
}
```

The above configuration applies globally for all metrics send to Dynatrace. If
you wish to dynamically configure information for a particular ZuploContext, you
can use the `DynatraceMetricsPlugin` in your code. Currently, the only
configuration you can set is the dimensions. The values you set here will be
appended to those set globally in the `zuplo.runtime.ts` file.

```ts
import {
  ZuploContext,
  ZuploRequest,
  DynatraceMetricsPlugin,
} from "@zuplo/runtime";

export default async function (request: ZuploRequest, context: ZuploContext) {
  const someValue = "hello";
  DynatraceMetricsPlugin.setContext(context, {
    dimentions: [`my-custom-dimension="${someValue}"`],
  });

  return "What zup?";
}
```
