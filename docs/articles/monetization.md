title: Zuplo API Monetization
---

Zuplo enables you, as an _API provider_, to effortlessly monetize your APIs. It
provides a compelling set of defaults, while also allowing customizations to
suit your company's unique business needs. You can easily create separate plans
for different customer segments, and set up pricing and usage limits for each.

With Zuplo, your customers can easily sign up for a plan, all within the
[Zuplo Developer Portal](/docs/articles/developer-portal.md). When your
customers visit the Developer Portal, they are presented with a list of plans
that you have created. They can sign up for a plan and start using your API
instantly.

Zuplo also provides powerful analytics for you as an API Provider. You can
easily track the overall usage of your API, or drill down to see the usage of a
particular customer.
