Azure DevOps integration is available on
[enterprise plans](https://zuplo.com/pricing). Contact
[support@zuplo.com](mailto:support@zuplo.com) to enable Azure DevOps for your
account.

Azure DevOps provides source control integration (push/pull between portal and
repository) but does not include automatic deployments. Use
[Azure Pipelines](./custom-ci-cd-azure.mdx) to deploy your API.
