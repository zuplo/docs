:::warning

The Monetization APIs are in preview and subject to change. Features and
endpoints documented here may be modified as we refine the service based on
customer feedback.

:::

Zuplo's Monetization API is a first-party metering and billing solution built
directly into the Zuplo platform. Developed from years of collaboration with our
enterprise customers and design partners, this API distills the patterns and
requirements we've seen across hundreds of API monetization implementations into
a streamlined, production-ready service.

## Built from Real-World Experience

While Zuplo continues to support
[integrations with third-party billing platforms](../monetization.mdx) like
Amberflo, Moesif, and Stripe, we've learned that many teams need a tightly
integrated, API-native metering solution. The Monetization API brings the
capabilities we've built for
[enterprise customers](../monetization-enterprise.mdx) into a self-service API
that any Zuplo user can adopt.

This API reflects lessons learned from:

- **Enterprise deployments** tracking billions of API calls monthly
- **Design partners** who shaped the feature set through real usage
- **Production workloads** that validated the architecture at scale

## Architecture

The Monetization API is built on [OpenMeter](https://openmeter.io/), an
open-source metering and billing foundation. The platform extends and customizes
the core to meet the specific requirements of API monetization at scale,
including deep integration with Zuplo's gateway infrastructure and
enterprise-grade reliability features.

## What the Monetization API Provides

- **Usage metering** - Track API calls, tokens, bytes, or any custom metric
- **Product catalog** - Define features and plans that map to your pricing page
- **Real-time queries** - Check usage instantly for quota enforcement or
  customer dashboards
- **Subscription management** - Connect usage to customers and billing periods

## Core Concepts

The Monetization API is built around three primary resources that form your
**Product Catalog**:

### Meters

Meters aggregate usage data from your API. You define an event type to watch and
a value to extract, and the meter sums those values across time windows and
customers. Use meters to track API calls, tokens processed, bytes transferred,
or any numeric metric.

### Features

Features describe what your API offers. These are the capabilities in your API
product - access to specific endpoints, higher rate limits, premium response
formats, or advanced functionality. Each feature can be tied to a meter to track
consumption.

### Plans

Plans are subscription tiers that package features together. They represent the
rows on your pricing page - Free, Pro, Enterprise - each with different feature
access and usage limits.

## API Authentication

All Monetization API requests require authentication using a Zuplo API key.

All examples in this documentation assume the following environment variables
are set in your terminal:

```bash
# Your Metering Bucket ID (Found in Settings > Project Information)
export BUCKET_ID=your-bucket-id
# Your Zuplo API Key (Found in Settings > Zuplo API Keys)
export ZAPI_KEY=zpka_YOUR_API_KEY
```

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```shell
curl \
  https://dev.zuplo.com/v3/metering/$BUCKET_ID/meters \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $ZAPI_KEY"
```

See [Zuplo API Keys](../accounts/zuplo-api-keys.mdx) for more information on
obtaining an API key.
