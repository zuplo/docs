Plans are subscription tiers that package features together. They represent the
rows on your pricing page - Free, Pro, Enterprise - each with different feature
access and usage limits. Plans define what customers get when they subscribe.

Plans contain **phases**, and each phase contains **rate cards** that define
pricing and entitlements. See [Rate Cards](./rate-cards.mdx) for details on
configuring pricing within plans.

:::note

Before creating a plan, you must first define the [Features](./features.mdx)
that will be included. Plans reference features by their `key`, so features must
exist before they can be added to rate cards.

:::

## Plan Lifecycle

Plans move through a defined lifecycle:

1. **Draft** - Initial state when created. Can be modified freely.
2. **Active** - Published and available for subscriptions. Cannot be modified.
3. **Archived** - No longer available for new subscriptions but existing
   subscriptions continue.

## Example: Pro Plan with Trial

This example creates a Pro plan with:

- A 1-week free trial phase with 1,000 API calls
- A default phase with $99/month subscription and 10,000 included API calls
- Overage pricing at $0.01 per additional call
- Static features for premium access

### How This Plan Works

| Phase   | Duration | API Calls          | Cost      |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------ | --------- |
| Trial   | 1 week   | 1,000 (hard limit) | Free      |
| Default | Ongoing  | 10,000 included    | $99/month |

After the trial ends, customers automatically move to the default phase. In the
default phase, the first 10,000 API calls are included in the $99 monthly fee.
Additional calls are billed at $0.01 each (soft limit allows overage).
