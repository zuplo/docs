Rate cards define the pricing and entitlements for features within a plan. Each
rate card connects a feature to a price and optionally sets usage limits or
access controls. Rate cards are the building blocks that turn your product
catalog into a monetizable offering.

## What Rate Cards Define

A rate card consists of:

- **Key and Name** - Identifiers for the rate card (auto-filled from feature if
  linked)
- **Feature** - Optional link to a feature from your product catalog
- **Price** - How much to charge (see [Pricing Models](./pricing-models.mdx))
- **Entitlement** - Optional usage limits or access controls
- **Billing Cadence** - How often to bill (monthly, one-time, etc.)

## Rate Card Types

### Flat Fee Rate Cards

Flat fee rate cards charge a fixed amount, either as a one-time charge or
recurring fee. Use these for:

- Setup fees or onboarding charges
- Monthly or annual subscription fees
- Access fees for premium features

```json
{
  "type": "flat_fee",
  "key": "platform_fee",
  "name": "Platform Fee",
  "billingCadence": "P1M",
  "price": {
    "type": "flat",
    "amount": "99.00"
  }
}
```

When `billingCadence` is set (e.g., `P1M` for monthly), the fee recurs each
billing period. When `billingCadence` is `null`, the fee is charged once per
subscription phase.

### Usage-Based Rate Cards

Usage-based rate cards charge based on metered consumption. These require a
feature linked to a meter. Use these for:

- Pay-per-request API pricing
- Token-based AI model pricing
- Data transfer charges

```json
{
  "type": "usage_based",
  "key": "api_calls",
  "name": "API Calls",
  "featureKey": "api_calls",
  "billingCadence": "P1M",
  "price": {
    "type": "unit",
    "amount": "0.001"
  }
}
```

Usage-based rate cards support multiple pricing models. See
[Pricing Models](./pricing-models.mdx) for details on unit, tiered, package, and
dynamic pricing.

## Rate Cards With Features

When a rate card is linked to a feature via `featureKey`:

- The rate card's `key` and `name` are pre-filled from the feature
- You can define entitlements to control access or set usage limits
- For metered features, the rate card can track and bill based on usage

### Entitlement Types

Entitlements define what customers get access to:

| Type      | Description                                    |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `boolean` | Simple on/off access to a feature              |
| `static`  | Access with custom configuration (JSON)        |
| `metered` | Access with usage tracking and optional limits |

#### Metered Entitlements

Metered entitlements are the most common for usage-based pricing. They can
include:

- **Usage limits** - Cap how much a customer can use
- **Soft limits** - Allow overage beyond the limit (with overage charges)
- **Initial grants** - Starting balance that resets each period

```json
{
  "type": "usage_based",
  "key": "api_calls",
  "name": "API Calls",
  "featureKey": "api_calls",
  "billingCadence": "P1M",
  "price": {
    "type": "unit",
    "amount": "0.001"
  },
  "entitlementTemplate": {
    "type": "metered",
    "issueAfterReset": 10000,
    "isSoftLimit": false
  }
}
```

This example grants 10,000 API calls per billing period with a hard limit.

## Rate Cards Without Features

Rate cards without features can only use flat fee pricing. The `key` and `name`
must be manually specified and will appear on invoices. These are useful for:

- Platform fees unrelated to specific features
- Service charges
- Custom line items

## Free Items

You can offer free items in three ways:

1. **Omit the price** - No price means free, and no payment method is required
2. **Set price to $0** - Explicit free, but payment method may still be required
3. **Apply 100% discount** - Shows original value with discount applied

## Adding Rate Cards to Plans

Rate cards are added to plan phases. See [Plans](./plans.mdx) for a complete
example of creating a plan with trial and default phases using rate cards.
