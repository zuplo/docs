The simplest workflow deploys your API to Zuplo on every push to main.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/deploy.yaml"
name: Deploy to Zuplo

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Deploy to Zuplo
        run: npx zuplo deploy --api-key "$ZUPLO_API_KEY"
        env:
          ZUPLO_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ZUPLO_API_KEY }}
```

This workflow:

1. Triggers on pushes to the `main` branch
2. Checks out your code
3. Installs dependencies (including the Zuplo CLI)
4. Deploys to Zuplo using the branch name as the environment name

Since this deploys from `main`, it updates your production environment.

## Next Steps

- Add [testing after deployment](./deploy-and-test.mdx)
- Set up [PR preview environments](./pr-preview-environments.mdx)
- Implement [tag-based releases](./tag-based-releases.mdx) for more control
