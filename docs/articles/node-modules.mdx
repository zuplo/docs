Zuplo generally supports node modules, but to ensure the security and
performance of each API Gateway we must approve each module. This process only
takes a few hours so if you need something new please reach out to use on
twitter [@zuplo](https://twitter.com/zuplo) or through email
[whatzup@zuplo.com](mailto:whatzup@zuplo.com)

Below are the currently installed modules.
