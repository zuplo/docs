Zuplo ships with an OpenTelemetry plugin that allows you to collect and export
telemetry data from your Zuplo API. The OpenTelemetry plugin supports tracing
and logging. Metrics support is planned for future releases.

<EnterpriseFeature name="OpenTelemetry" />

## Tracing

Tracing enables you to monitor performance, identify bottlenecks, and
troubleshoot issues in your Zuplo API. The OpenTelemetry plugin automatically
instruments your API to collect trace data. You can send trace data any
OpenTelemetry service such as [Honeycomb](https://honeycomb.io),
[Middleware](https://middleware.io/), [Dynatrace](https://dynatrace.com),
[Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/), and
[many more](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/).

With tracing enabled on your Zuplo API you will see timings for each request as
well as spans for plugins, handlers, and policies. The OpenTelemetry plugin
supports trace propagation (W3C headers by default) so you can trace requests
all the way from the client to your backend.

### What's Traced?

By default, when the OpenTelemetry plugin is enabled, the following is traced:

- Request: The entire request lifecycle is traced, including the time taken to
  process the request and send the response.
- Inbound Policies: The time taken to execute all inbound policies as well as
  each policy is traced.
- Handler: The request handler is traced
- Outbound Policies: The time taken to execute all outbound policies as well as
  each policy is traced.
- Subrequests: Any use of `fetch` within your custom policies or handlers will
  be traced.

### Limitations

One important limitation to keep in mind is that the clock will only increment
when performing I/O operations (for example when calling `fetch`, using the
Cache APIs, etc.). This is a limitation imposed as a security measure due
Zuplo's serverless, multi-tenant architecture. In practice this shouldn't impact
your ability to trace as virtually any code that isn't I/O bound is fast.

### Custom Tracing

You can add custom tracing to your Zuplo API by using the OpenTelemetry API. The
example below shows how to implement tracing in a custom policy.

```ts
import { ZuploContext, ZuploRequest } from "@zuplo/runtime";
import { trace } from "@opentelemetry/api";

export default async function policy(
  request: ZuploRequest,
  context: ZuploContext,
) {
  const tracer = trace.getTracer("my-tracer");
  return tracer.startActiveSpan("my-span", async (span) => {
    span.setAttribute("key", "value");

    try {
      const results = await Promise.all([
        fetch("https://api.example.com/hello"),
        fetch("https://api.example.com/world"),
      ]);
      // ...

      return request;
    } finally {
      span.end();
    }
  });
}
```

This will result in a span that has the following spans:

```txt
|--- my-policy
|    |
|    |--- my-span
|    |    |
|    |    |--- GET https://api.example.com/hello
|    |    |
|    |    |--- GET https://api.example.com/world
```

## Logging

Logging can be enabled by configuring the `logUrl` property in the OpenTelemetry
plugin configuration, as shown in
[Tracing and Logging Configuration](#tracing-and-logging-configuration). When
enabled, logs will be exported to the specified endpoint in OpenTelemetry
format.

To add OpenTelemetry logs in your Zuplo handlers and policies, you can use the
`context.log` object as shown below:

```ts
import { ZuploContext, ZuploRequest } from "@zuplo/runtime";

export default async function policy(
  request: ZuploRequest,
  context: ZuploContext,
) {
  context.log.info("Hello World");
  return request;
}
```

You can also set additional custom log properties using
`context.log.setLogProperties!`:

```ts
import { ZuploContext, ZuploRequest } from "@zuplo/runtime";

export default async function policy(
  request: ZuploRequest,
  context: ZuploContext,
) {
  context.log.setLogProperties!({ customProperty: "value" });
  context.log.info("Hello World");
  return request;
}
```

After setting a custom property, all subsequent log messages will include that
property.

These logs will be exported to the configured log endpoint in OpenTelemetry
format. The log message will be in the `message` field and the custom properties
will be in the `attributes` field.

## Setup

Adding OpenTelemetry to your Zuplo API is done by adding the
`OpenTelemetryPlugin` in the `zuplo.runtime.ts` file as shown below.

:::warning{title="OpenTelemetry Protocol"}

The Zuplo OpenTelemetry plugin only supports sending data in JSON format. Not
all OpenTelemetry services support the JSON format. If you are using a service
that doesn't support JSON, you will need to use a tool like the
[OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) that can
convert the JSON format to the format required by your service.

:::

### Basic Tracing Configuration

For most providers you will set values for `exporter.url` and
`exporter.headers`. It's common for providers to use a header for authorization.

```ts title="zuplo.runtime.ts"
import { OpenTelemetryPlugin } from "@zuplo/otel";
import { RuntimeExtensions, environment } from "@zuplo/runtime";

export function runtimeInit(runtime: RuntimeExtensions) {
  runtime.addPlugin(
    new OpenTelemetryPlugin({
      exporter: {
        url: "https://otel-collector.example.com/v1/traces",
        headers: {
          "api-key": environment.OTEL_API_KEY,
        },
      },
      service: {
        name: "my-api",
        version: "1.0.0",
      },
    }),
  );
}
```

### Advanced Tracing Configuration

The OpenTelemetry plugin supports additional configuration options for advanced
use cases, including sampling and post-processing of spans.

```ts title="zuplo.runtime.ts"
import { OpenTelemetryPlugin } from "@zuplo/otel";
import { RuntimeExtensions, environment } from "@zuplo/runtime";

export function runtimeInit(runtime: RuntimeExtensions) {
  runtime.addPlugin(
    new OpenTelemetryPlugin({
      exporter: {
        url: "https://otel-collector.example.com/v1/traces",
        headers: { "api-key": environment.OTEL_API_KEY },
      },
      service: {
        name: "my-api",
        version: "1.0.0",
      },
      // Optional post processor to modify spans before export
      postProcessor: (spans) => {
        for (const span of spans) {
          (
            span as unknown as { attributes: Record<string, unknown> }
          ).attributes["post.processed"] = true;
        }
        return spans;
      },
      sampling: {
        headSampler: {
          ratio: 0.1, // Sample 10% of requests
        },
      },
    }),
  );
}
```

### Tracing and Logging Configuration

Logging is only enabled when specifically configured with its own endpoint using
the `logUrl` property. When using both tracing and logging, you can configure
them with separate endpoints.

```ts title="zuplo.runtime.ts"
import { OpenTelemetryPlugin } from "@zuplo/otel";
import { RuntimeExtensions, environment } from "@zuplo/runtime";

export function runtimeInit(runtime: RuntimeExtensions) {
  runtime.addPlugin(
    new OpenTelemetryPlugin({
      logUrl: "https://otel-collector.example.com/v1/logs",
      traceUrl: "https://otel-collector.example.com/v1/traces",
      headers: { "api-key": environment.OTEL_API_KEY },
      service: {
        name: "my-api",
        version: "1.0.0",
      },
      sampling: {
        headSampler: {
          ratio: 0.1, // Sample 10% of requests
        },
      },
    }),
  );
}
```
