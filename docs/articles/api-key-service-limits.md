title: Service Limits
---

Zuplo's API Key Service can handle billions of requests and tokens. The service
can accommodate even virtually any scale required. However, by default the
service is set with limits to ensure that each Zuplo customer has a performant
and reliable experience.

For customers who need limits beyond what is set in this document, react out to
our sales team and we'll be happy to design a plan that fits your needs. Email
[sales@zuplo.com](mailto:sales@zuplo.com).

For more details see [Zuplo Platform Limits](./limits.md).
