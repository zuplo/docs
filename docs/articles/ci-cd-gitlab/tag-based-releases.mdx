Deploy only when tags are pushed for controlled releases.

```yaml title=".gitlab-ci.yml"
image: node:20

stages:
  - deploy

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - npm install
    - npx zuplo deploy --api-key "$ZUPLO_API_KEY" --environment "$CI_COMMIT_TAG"
  only:
    - tags
```

This pipeline triggers only on tags and creates an environment named after the
tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`).

## Next Steps

- Add [multi-stage deployment](./multi-stage-deployment.mdx) with approval
