## Launching a new API

Most of our startup customers are looking to launch an API and want to achieve a
'Stripe-quality' API experience for their customers quickly. This mean a highly
performant and secure API with beautiful and up-to-date documentation and usage
analytics.

Zuplo makes this achievable for small teams, saving you time, money and
engineering effort. Using Zuplo allows you to avoid building out common features
like API key authentication, rate-limiting, quotas, request validation,
monetization, and developer documentation.

Our promise is that Zuplo should be **cheaper** and **faster** than building
these features yourself, while future-proofing your architecture. Check out our
[Build vs Buy Guide](https://zuplo.com/build-vs-buy-api-management-tools) to
learn more.

## Managing multiple APIs

Most of our larger customers are managing multiple APIs behind Zuplo, including
multiple internal APIs. In some cases combining multiple backends into a single
API but also using Zuplo as a way to ensure that all APIs are using consistent
Authentication, Rate-Limiting and other common policies described by their
internal best practices.

Development teams also prefer Zuplo over other API Management products because
it allows for a more collaborative workflow within the team. Each team can
create as many deployments as necessary for exploration and testing, while
architects and leadership can maintain control over protected branches (QA,
staging, production) with a clean CI/CD integrated workflow.

## Microservices Gateway

Many customers are looking to Zuplo to augment or replace their traditional
microservices gateway as an easier to use, fully managed solution with built-in
serverless auto scale. Zuplo might be used to create a single API, with a
programmable orchestration layer hosted on Zuplo.

Some of our customers use Zuplo as a smart-routing layer, with each request
being routed to different, isolated backends based on user credentials or other
metadata. This is covered in this
[video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC-HuZqEEPE).

## API over BaaS

Some of our smaller customers are choosing to use Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)
solutions like Supabase, Firebase etc and want to use Zuplo as programmable
API-first presentation of their backend. More on this scenario in this
[video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJSkbxMnWxE).
