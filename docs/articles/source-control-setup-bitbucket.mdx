Bitbucket integration is available on
[enterprise plans](https://zuplo.com/pricing). Bitbucket provides source control
integration (push/pull between portal and repository) but does not include
automatic deployments. Use [Bitbucket Pipelines](./custom-ci-cd-bitbucket.mdx)
to deploy your API.

## Bitbucket.org

If you are using the SaaS Bitbucket hosted at bitbucket.org, contact
[support@zuplo.com](mailto:support@zuplo.com) to enable Bitbucket on your
account.

Provide support with your Bitbucket Workspace ID, found on your Workspace
Settings page.

## Self-Hosted Bitbucket

For self-hosted Bitbucket, you need to
[set up a custom Bitbucket OAuth App](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/integrate-another-application-through-oauth/)
and provide Zuplo support with the following values:

- **Bitbucket Server URL** — Something like `https://bitbucket.example.com`
- **Client ID** — The client ID of the Bitbucket app you created
- **Client Secret** — The client secret of the Bitbucket app you created

When configuring your app you will need to set the following values:

- **Callback URL** - `https://portal.zuplo.com`
- **Permissions** - `repo user read:org`

## Limiting Access

Bitbucket doesn't support scoping OAuth app access to specific repositories.
This is a Bitbucket limitation. To limit Zuplo's access:

1. Create a new workspace and install the Zuplo app only in that workspace
2. Create a service account user with limited repository access and use that
   user to connect Bitbucket to Zuplo
