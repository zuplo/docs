title: Step 5 - Adding project collaborators
---

In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps to add a new user to your
account and share the project with them.

A project can only be shared if the account plan allows for multiple users and
if the project has been connected to source control. If you haven't configured
the project with source control follow the
[Step 4 - Deploying to the Edge](./step-4-deploying-to-the-edge.md) article.

## 1/ Adding a new user to the account

To add a new user to your account, click on the "Account Settings" tab on the
left-side navigation of the Project List page, that will take you to the
"Account Members" settings.

From there, type their email address under the "Manage Access" section and click
"Invite". This will send them an email invite with a link they'll to use to
accept being added to the account.

Once the new user has accepted the account invite you'll be able to share a
project with them.

## 2/ Adding a user to the project

To share a project with a new user, open the project you want to add them to and
click on the "Project Settings" tab in the left-side navigation. Select
"Members" and in the "Share Project" section pick their email address from the
"Select a user" picklist and click "Share".

project with them.
