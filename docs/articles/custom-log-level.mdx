There are four logging levels in Zuplo:

- `error`
- `warn`
- `info`
- `debug`

If the log level is set to `debug` - all entries are logged. If it is set to
`warn`, only `warn` and `error` events are logged. Zuplo defaults the log level
to `debug` (everything) for working-copy environments and `error` for everything
else. You can override this by setting an
[environment variable](../articles/environment-variables) called
`ZUPLO_LOG_LEVEL` to one of the values above.

:::warning

The log levels are case sensitive - they must be entered correctly, in lower
case for logging to work.

:::

The log levels map to the different methods on `context.log`, e.g.

```ts
context.log.error("error level event");
context.log.warn("debug level event");
context.log.info("info level event");
context.log.log("'log' is also an info level event");
context.log.debug("debug level event");
```
