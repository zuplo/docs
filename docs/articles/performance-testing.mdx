title: Performance Testing
---

Performance testing is an important part of building a reliable, scalable, and
performant API. This document outlines how to performance test your API behind
Zuplo, some best practices, and how to interpret the results.

This document applies only to Zuplo's serverless edge-based deployment. If you
are running a managed dedicated instance of Zuplo, this document doesn't apply
as the scaling characteristics are different.

## Cold Starts

One thing to keep in mind with Zuplo is that it's a "serverless" platform. This
means that we automatically scale your API to handle any load. This makes Zuplo
cost effective and scalable for APIs that have almost no traffic, APIs that have
billions of requests per month, and API that have unpredictable traffic. Zuplo
handles it all with ease.

The caveat is that the first requests of a test may be slightly slower than they
will be once the API is warmed up. This "code start" time is typically less than
200ms. Nodes in Zuplo are reused for many requests. Nodes can live for hours or
even days, but they are eventually recycled. Nodes are also spun up and down
based on traffic.

What this means for load testing is that you need to run a "warm-up" test before
measuring the latency of your API.
