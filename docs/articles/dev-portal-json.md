title: Developer Portal Config File
---

The `dev-portal.json` file is the code that drives most of the configuration of your Zuplo Gateway. The primary uses of the `dev-portal.json` file are:

- Enabling or disabling features of the Gateway
- Setting custom values to various configuration
- Mapping environment variables to settings

:::tip

The `dev-portal.json` file can be edited through a more [rich experience](../articles/developer-portal) in the <SettingsTabIcon /> **Settings** tab of the Zuplo Portal.

:::

Below is an example of a `dev-portal.json` file that is used to configure custom authentication to the [Developer Portal](../articles/developer-portal).

```json
{
  "enableAuthentication": true,
  "authentication": {
    "authority": "https://dev-123566.okta.com/oauth2/ausXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "jwksUrl": "https://dev-123566.okta.com/oauth2/ausXXXXXXXXXXXX/v1/keys",
    "provider": "okta",
    "devPortalClient": {
      "clientId": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
      "audience": "api://my-api"
    }
  }
}
```

  - **devPortalClient**
    - **clientId** - The OAuth Client ID used by the Developer Portal for the [Authorization Code OAuth flow](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-proof-key-for-code-exchange-pkce)
    - **audience** - The [audience](https://auth0.com/docs/glossary#A:~:text=multi%2Dfactor%20authentication.-,Audience,-The%20unique%20identifier) of you Zuplo API

## Mapping environment variables to settings

[Environment variables](./environment-variables.md) can be used instead of hard-coded settings inside of the `dev-portal.json` file. This is the best practice when setting secret values like `apiKey`. Using environment variables is also useful when settings change by environment. For example, if you use different OAuth Clients depending on environment.

Any **whole** value in the `dev-portal.json` file can be substituted for an environment variable. Substitution is done by setting the string value to `$env(MY_VARIABLE_NAME)` where `MY_VARIABLE_NAME` is the name of your config or secret environment variable.

Below is an example `dev-portal.json` file with several values substituted by environment variables.

```json
{
  "enableAuthentication": true,
  "authentication": {
    "authority": "$env(OKTA_DEV_PORTAL_AUTHORITY)",
    "jwksUrl": "$env(OKTA_DEV_PORTAL_JWKS_URL)",
    "provider": "okta",
    "devPortalClient": {
      "clientId": "$env(OKTA_DEV_PORTAL_CLIENT_ID",
      "audience": "api://my-api"
    }
  }
}
```
