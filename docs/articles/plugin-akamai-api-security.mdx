title: Akamai API Security (AKA NONAME) plugin
sidebar_label: Akamai API Security
---

This plugin pushes request/response data to Akamai API Security, formerly known
as "NONAME" API Security. It can also pull data from Akamai API Security to
actively block traffic based on the blocklist rules provided by Akamai API
Security; known as "Protection".

<EnterpriseFeature name="Custom logging" />

## Setup

To get started, you'll need to configure the Zuplo Integration in Akamai API
Security. Once this step is completed you'll have a 'key' to allow us to connect
to Akamai API Security on your behalf.

In Zuplo you configure the plugin in the
[Runtime Extensions](../programmable-api/runtime-extensions.mdx) file
`zuplo.runtime.ts`, as follows:

```ts title="modules/zuplo.runtime.ts"
import {
  environment,
  AkamaiApiSecurityPlugin,
  RuntimeExtensions,
  ZuploContext,
  ZuploRequest,
} from "@zuplo/runtime";

export function runtimeInit(runtime: RuntimeExtensions) {
  runtime.addPlugin(
    new AkamaiApiSecurityPlugin({
      hostname: "your-akamai-api-security-hostname.com",
      // index, provided by Akamai API Security
      index: 1,
      // Key provided by Akamai API Security
      key: environment.AKAMAI_API_SECURITY_KEY,
      // Enable the active prevention/protection feature
      enableProtection: true,
    }),
  );
}
```

It is recommended to store your key in an
[Environment Variable](./environment-variables.mdx) shown in the example above
`AKAMAI_API_SECURITY_KEY`. If you want the active protection feature enabled,
set `enableProtection` to `true`.

The plugin also supports an optional `shouldLog` parameter which is a function
that returns true or false and, if false, stops the request/response from
logging to Akamai API Security.

```ts
runtime.addPlugin(
  new AkamaiApiSecurityPlugin({
    hostname: "your-akamai-api-security-hostname.com",
    // index, provided by Akamai API Security
    index: 1,
    // Key provided by Akamai API Security
    key: environment.AKAMAI_API_SECURITY_KEY,
    // Enable the active prevention/protection feature
    enableProtection: true,
    // optional filter function to exclude requests
    shouldLog: async (request: ZuploRequest, context: ZuploContext) => {
      if (request.headers.get("content-type") !== "application/json") {
        return false;
      }

      return true;
    },
  }),
);
```
