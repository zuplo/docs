<EnterpriseFeature name="Secure tunneling" />

## Setting up Tunnels

A tunnel is a way to expose your _internal services_ to the Zuplo gateway
without exposing it to the public internet. Your Zuplo Gateway accesses those
services through the `service://` protocol.

The easiest way to deploy your tunnel is using a Docker container. The three
basic requirements for deploying a secure tunnel with Docker are:

1. A tunnel secret that's provided to the Docker container as an environment
   variable named `TUNNEL_TOKEN` (the secret is provided by the Zuplo CLI when
   you create the tunnel. See [creating a tunnel](../cli/tunnel-create.mdx))
1. The ability for the tunnel service to make an outbound connection to the
   public internet to establish the secure tunnel.
1. The ability for the tunnel service to make a request to your internal API by
   a DNS address. (for example `https://my-service.local/api`).

The tunnel can run anywhere you can deploy a Docker container. Where you deploy
depends on your specific setup. To run the Docker container on your own
infrastructure, refer to instructions from your cloud provider or contact
[Zuplo support](mailto:support@zuplo.com) for assistance.

Below are a few option for deploying the tunnel.

- [Deploying Docker containers on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/run-docker-with-azure-container-instances/)
- [Deploying Docker containers on AWS ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/userguide/getting-started.html)
- [Deploying container images to GCP](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/containers/deploying-containers)

The docker container is `zuplo/tunnel` and is available on
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/zuplo/tunnel).

Your running container needs a single environment variable named `TUNNEL_TOKEN`.
You should store the value as a secret using the recommended means of secret
storage and environment variable injection for your platform.

## Configuring services

Once you have created a tunnel, you can
[configure which services](../cli/tunnel-services-update.mdx) it should expose
using a configuration file. Below is a sample configuration file. The properties
in the `services` objects are explained below.

- `name` - This is the name of the service that you will use from your Zuplo
  project
- `endpoint` - This is the local endpoint of your service that you tunnel can
  connect to
- `configurations` - This object specifies which projects and which environments
  can access this service.
  - `project` - The name of the Zuplo project
  - `accessibleBy` - The environments which can use the tunnel. Valid values are
    `production`, `preview`, and `working-copy`.

```json title="tunnel-config.json"
{
  "version": 1,
  "services": [
    {
      "name": "my-awesome-service-prod",
      "endpoint": "http://localhost:8000",
      "configurations": [
        {
          "project": "my-project",
          "accessibleBy": ["production"]
        },
        {
          "project": "my-other-project",
          "accessibleBy": ["production"]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "my-awesome-service-staging",
      "endpoint": "http://localhost:9000",
      "configurations": [
        {
          "project": "my-project",
          "accessibleBy": ["preview", "working-copy"]
        },
        {
          "project": "my-other-project",
          "accessibleBy": ["preview", "working-copy"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

```bash
zuplo tunnel services update \
--configuration-file <path-to-your-configuration-file> \
--tunnel-id <your-tunnel-id>
```

## Using Services Exposed through Tunnels in Code

Once set up, the services in the tunnels can be treated like any API host that
you call from your Zuplo gateway. Each service exposed through tunnels is called
with the URL schema `service://`, so if your service is named
`my-awesome-service` you will call it using the URL
`service://my-awesome-service`.

This URL can be used in code as shown below.

```ts
import { ZuploContext, ZuploRequest } from "@zuplo/runtime";

export default async function (request: ZuploRequest, context: ZuploContext) {
  const response = await fetch("service://my-awesome-service/hello-world");
  if (response.status > 399) {
    return "It didn't work. :(";
  } else {
    return response;
  }
}
```

It's common to have multiple services for each of your internal environments.
Each service can be restricted so that it's only accessible by specific Zuplo
environments. For example, you might have two services one for production and
one for staging.

- `service://my-awesome-service-prod` (Production)
- `service://my-awesome-service-staging` (Staging)

## Using Services Exposed through Tunnels in Configuration

Services can also be used in routes.oas.json file such as with the URL Rewrite
handler. To call a tunnel service simply use it as part of the rewrite URL as
shown in the image below.

## Service Environment Variables

When using these services in your code or configuration, it's often useful to
store the values as an environment variable. This way you can change which
environment calls which tunnel without changing code or configuration.

For the production environment you would set the `BASE_SERVICE_URL` to the
production service name. See
[this document](../articles/environment-variables.mdx) for more about
[Environment Variables](../articles/environment-variables.mdx)

```text
BASE_SERVICE_URL=service://my-awesome-service-prod
```

And for staging, you would use the staging service name.

```text
BASE_SERVICE_URL=service://my-awesome-service-staging
```

In your handler code or other configuration, the service can be accessed using
the environment variable.

```ts
import { ZuploContext, ZuploRequest, environment } from "@zuplo/runtime";

export default async function (request: ZuploRequest, context: ZuploContext) {
  const response = await fetch(`${environment.BASE_SERVICE_URL}/hello-world`);
  if (response.status > 399) {
    return "It didn't work. :(";
  } else {
    return response;
  }
}
```

Environment variables can also be used in configuration, such as the URL Rewrite
handler as shown below.

## Tunnel Upgrades

Zuplo publishes a new release of the tunnel Docker image about once per month or
whenever Cloudflare ships a release to their underlying tunnel tools. The most
recent version of the Docker Image is always tagged with the `latest` tag. We
recommend periodically checking and upgrading the tunnel to the latest release
to ensure you have the latest security and performance updates.

We recommend testing each release of the tunnel in a staging environment before
rolling out to production.
