title: Securing your backend
---

When using a gateway, it's important to ensure that your backend API is only
receiving traffic via the gateway to be confident that your policies are being
correctly applied to all traffic.

To do this, we need to secure the communication between Zuplo and your backend
APIs (origin). There are several options to do this securely.

## 1/ Shared secret / API Key

This is the most popular option and is used by companies like Supabase,
Firebase, and Stripe to secure their own APIs. In this solution the backend
requires a secret that is known only by the gateway. This is usually an opaque
key sent as a header on every request to the origin. Zuplo adds this to the
request - the client is never aware of the secret. An example of how to set this
up, is show in the
[Securing your Backend with a Shared Secret](./securing-backend-shared-secret.md)
article.

## 2/ Federated Authentication

This is a new option where you can configure your cloud service (e.g. GCP or
AWS) to trust a JWT token created by the Zuplo runtime. If you're interested in
using this option please contact us at `support@zuplo.com`.

## 3/ Upstream Service Authentication

Utilize the IAM controls provided by your Cloud host to secure inbound requests
and allow only authorized service principals access to your service.

- For Azure users, you can user our
  [Upstream Azure AD Service Auth](../policies/upstream-azure-ad-service-auth-inbound.md)
  policy. This uses Azure AD App registrations to create a token that Zuplo will
  send to requests to Azure.

- For GCP users, you can use our
  [Upstream GCP Service AUth](../policies/upstream-gcp-service-auth-inbound.md)
  or [Upstream GCP JWT](../policies/upstream-gcp-jwt-inbound.md) policies. These
  use a service.json credential to create or issue JWT tokens that Zuplo will
  send to requests to GCP.

## 4/ mTLS Authentication

Mutual Certificate authentication allows the configuration of a trust
relationship between your Zuplo gateway and your backend API using certificates.
If you're interested in using this option please contact us at
`support@zuplo.com`.

## 5/ Secure Tunneling

Used by some of our larger customers, our [secure tunnels](./secure-tunnel.md)
allow you to create a WireGuard based tunnel from your VPC or private
data-center that connects directly to your Zuplo gateway. This option is
generally useful when running workloads in a non-cloud provider (i.e. bare
metal, on premises, etc.) that do not have IAM or mTLS capabilities. In this
solution, your backend API does not need to be exposed to the internet at all.
This is a more complex setup and is only available on our
[enterprise plan](https://zuplo.com/pricing).

To discuss security and connectivity options, our
[discord channel](https://discord.zuplo.com) is a great community, with active
participation from the Zuplo team.
