GitLab integration is available on
[enterprise plans](https://zuplo.com/pricing). Contact
[support@zuplo.com](mailto:support@zuplo.com) to enable GitLab for your account.

GitLab provides source control integration (push/pull between portal and
repository) but does not include automatic deployments. Use
[GitLab CI/CD pipelines](./custom-ci-cd-gitlab.mdx) to deploy your API.
