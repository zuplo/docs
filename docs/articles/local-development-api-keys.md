sidebar_label: API Keys

To use API keys locally, you must have a Zuplo account and an existing project.
You will be using the API keys from the working-copy of your project.

1. Run `npx zup login` to log into your account in your browser.
2. Run `npx zup link` to bring in relevant information from your Zuplo account
   and project.
3. At this point, you will see a file called `.env.zuplo` containing some
   information about the the API key bucket you can use.

:::warning

As the .env.zuplo file could contain sensitive information, it should not be
committed to your version system. Consider adding .env to your .gitignore file.

:::

4. You can run `npm run dev` as normal. The Zuplo CLI will automatically pick up
   the API keys from the `.env.zuplo` file.
