In this guide, you'll learn how to configure Okta as an authorization server for
use with the MCP Server handler. See the
[MCP Server Handler docs](../handlers/mcp-server.mdx#oauth-authentication) for
instructions on how to configure your Zuplo gateway to support OAuth
authentication for your MCP Server.

This guide will assume that you already have a working Okta account and
organization.

## Create an Auth Server

First, you will need to create an Okta authorization server. This server will be
used to authorize requests to your MCP Server per
[the Model Context Protocol authorization specification.](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/authorization)

1. In the Okta Admin Console, navigate to **Security > API** in the left
   sidebar.
2. Click **Add Authorization Server**.
3. Set the **Name** to something like "MCP Server Authorization".
4. Set the **Audience** to the canonical URL of your MCP Server. For example, if
   your MCP Server is hosted at `https://my-gateway.zuplo.dev/mcp`, then the
   audience would be `https://my-gateway.zuplo.dev/mcp`. **The trailing slash is
   not required.**
5. Add a **Description** and click **Save**.

Note the **Issuer Metadata URI** shown in the authorization server details.
You'll need this for your Zuplo configuration.

## Configure Scopes

Next, you'll need to configure the scopes for your authorization server.

1. In your authorization server settings, click the **Scopes** tab.
2. Click **Add Scope**.
3. Set the **Name** to something like `mcp:access`.
4. Add a **Display phrase** and **Description** (like "Access to MCP Server
   tools").
5. Check **Set as a default scope** and click **Create**.

## Create an OAuth Client Application

Next, you'll need to create an OAuth client application for your MCP server.

:::note

Okta requires an admin API key for to dynamically register clients. This may not
be well supported by MCP clients. However, MCP clients should also support an
alternative way to obtain a client ID and client credential. This document
assumes an MCP client can set these fields without having to dynamically
register a client.

:::

1. In the Okta Admin Console, navigate to **Applications > Applications** in the
   left sidebar.
2. Click **Create App Integration**.
3. Select **OIDC - OpenID Connect** as the sign-in method.
4. Select **Web Application** as the application type and click **Next**.
5. Set the **App integration name** to something like "MCP Client Application".
6. For **Grant types**, check **Authorization Code** and **Refresh Token**.
7. For **Sign-in redirect URIs**, leave this empty or set to a placeholder like
   `http://localhost:3000/callback`.
8. For **Controlled access**, select **Allow everyone in your organization to
   access**.
9. Click **Save**.

After creating the application, note the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
from the application's **General** tab. You'll need these for your MCP client
configuration.

## Create a Default Policy and Rule

You'll need to create an access policy for your authorization server.

1. In your authorization server settings (found in **Security > API**) click the
   **Access Policies** tab.
2. Click **Add New Access Policy**.
3. Set the **Name** to something like "MCP Client Access Policy".
4. Add a **Description** and assign it to **All clients**.
5. Click **Create Policy**.

Now create a rule for this policy:

1. Click **Add Rule** within your new policy.
2. Set the **Rule Name** to something like "Allow MCP Access".
3. In the **IF AND** section:
   - **Grant type is**: Select the grant type. For the widest grant for all MCP
     clients, select **Client Credentials**, **Authorization Code**, and
     **Device Authorization** (???)
   - **User is**: Select **Any user assigned the app**
   - **Scopes requested**: Select **The following scopes** and choose the scope
     you created for the authorization server (that is, `mcp:access`)
4. In the **THEN AND** section:
   - **Use this inline hook**: None (disabled)
   - **Access token lifetime is**: Set to desired value (for example, 1 hour)
   - **Refresh token lifetime is**: Set to desired value (for example, 90 days)
5. Click **Create Rule**.

## Configure OAuth on Zuplo

To set up your gateway to support OAuth authentication for your MCP Server, you
will need to do the following:

1. Create an Okta JWT Auth inbound policy on your MCP Server route. This policy
   will need to have the option `"oAuthResourceMetadataEnabled": true` to enable
   authorization resource metadata discovery.

   ```json
   {
     "name": "mcp-okta-oauth-inbound",
     "policyType": "okta-jwt-auth-inbound",
     "handler": {
       "export": "OktaJwtInboundPolicy",
       "module": "$import(@zuplo/runtime)",
       "options": {
         "oAuthResourceMetadataEnabled": true,
         "audience": "https://my-gateway.zuplo.dev/mcp",
         "issuer": "https://your-okta-domain.okta.com/oauth2/your-auth-server-id"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   - Replace `my-gateway.zuplo.dev/mcp` with the audience you defined in your
     authorization server.
   - Replace `your-okta-domain` in the `issuer` field with your actual Okta
     domain.
   - Replace `your-auth-server-id` in the `issuer` field with the actual ID of
     your Okta authorization server.

2. Add the OAuth policy to the MCP Server route. For example:

   ```json
   "paths": {
     "/mcp": {
       "post": {
         "x-zuplo-route": {

           // etc. etc.
           // other properties for the MCP server route handler

           "policies": {
             "inbound": [
               "mcp-oauth-inbound"
             ]
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Add the `OAuthProtectedResourcePlugin` to your `runtimeInit` function in the
   `modules/zuplo.runtime.ts` file:

   ```ts
   import {
     RuntimeExtensions,
     OAuthProtectedResourcePlugin,
   } from "@zuplo/runtime";

   export function runtimeInit(runtime: RuntimeExtensions) {
     runtime.addPlugin(
       new OAuthProtectedResourcePlugin({
         authorizationServers: [
           "https://your-okta-domain.okta.com/oauth2/your-auth-server-id",
         ],
         resourceName: "My MCP OAuth Resource",
       }),
     );
   }
   ```

   - Replace `your-okta-domain` in the `issuer` field with your actual Okta
     domain.
   - Replace `your-auth-server-id` in the `issuer` field with the actual ID of
     your Okta authorization server.

   This plugin populates the `.well-known` routes for the MCP server auth
   metadata discovery. This enables MCP clients to automatically discover the
   authorization issuer endpoint. See the
   [OAuth Protected Resource Plugin docs](../programmable-api/oauth-protected-resource-plugin)
   for more details on this runtime plugin.

## Testing

The [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) doesn't
currently support setting an initial access token or presenting a UI for setting
the client ID or secret.

Refer to the [Manual OAuth MCP Testing](./manual-mcp-oauth-testing) guide for
further instructions on testing your MCP server with `curl`.

If you need more help debugging, see
[Testing OAuth on Zuplo](../handlers/mcp-server.md#oauth-testing).
