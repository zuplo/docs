Zuplo provides automatic DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) protection for all
APIs deployed on the platform. This service detects and mitigates attacks in
real-time, ensuring your APIs remain available even under attack.

:::note

Zuplo Managed DDoS is only available for customers using Zuplo's managed edge
deployment model. Customers using managed dedicated deployments should refer to
the
[Managed Dedicated WAF Options](./zuplo-waf.mdx#managed-dedicated-waf-options)
document.

## What is DDoS?

DDoS attacks attempt to overwhelm your API by flooding it with malicious traffic
from multiple sources. Zuplo's protection covers both:

- **Network Layer Attacks (Layer 3/4)**: UDP floods, SYN floods, and other
  network-level attacks
- **Application Layer Attacks (Layer 7)**: HTTP floods, slowloris, and other
  application-level attacks

## Key Benefits

- **Always-On**: Protection is automatic from deploymentâ€”no configuration needed
- **Multi-Layer Defense**: Covers both network and application layer attacks
- **Unmetered Protection**: No bandwidth limits during attacks
- **Adaptive**: Continuously updated to handle new attack patterns
- **Minimal False Positives**: Smart detection reduces blocking of legitimate
  traffic
- **Avoid Unexpected Costs**: Zuplo never charges for requests that are blocked
  by DDoS protection protecting you from unexpected overage fees.

## Protection Levels

Zuplo offers different sensitivity levels for DDoS protection, allowing you to
balance security with accessibility based on your specific needs.

### Working Copy Environments

All Working Copy environments (`.zuplo.dev` domains) are automatically protected
with **Medium** sensitivity. This provides robust protection while minimizing
the risk of blocking legitimate traffic during development and testing.

### Preview and Production Environments

Preview and production deployments benefit from advanced DDoS protection
capabilities:

- **Default Setting**: Medium sensitivity (balanced protection)
- **Enterprise Customization**: Optional enterprise add-on allowing
  configuration of protection levels

### Sensitivity Levels Explained

Enterprise customers with the DDoS customization add-on can choose from four
sensitivity levels:

#### High Sensitivity

- Most aggressive protection with the lowest threshold for triggering mitigation
- Ideal for APIs that face frequent attacks or handle highly sensitive data
- May occasionally block legitimate traffic during unusual usage patterns

#### Medium Sensitivity (Default)

- Balanced approach providing strong protection with moderate thresholds
- Recommended for most production APIs
- Optimizes for both security and accessibility

#### Low Sensitivity

- Higher threshold for triggering mitigation
- Suitable for APIs with highly variable traffic patterns
- Reduces false positives for legitimate traffic spikes

#### Essentially Off

- Minimal protection with the highest threshold
- Protection still activates for extremely large attacks to maintain network
  stability
- Recommended only when you have alternative DDoS protection mechanisms.

## How Protection Works

### Detection

Zuplo's DDoS protection uses sophisticated algorithms to analyze traffic
patterns in real-time. The system examines multiple factors including:

- Request rates and patterns
- Source IP reputation
- Geographic distribution
- Protocol compliance
- Behavioral anomalies

### Mitigation

When an attack is detected, the system automatically applies appropriate
mitigation techniques:

1. **Traffic Filtering**: Malicious traffic is filtered at the edge before
   reaching your API
2. **Rate Limiting**: Excessive requests from suspicious sources are throttled
3. **Connection Management**: Advanced TCP protection handles sophisticated
   connection-based attacks

### Continuous Improvement

The protection system continuously evolves:

- Managed rulesets are regularly updated
- New attack patterns are incorporated into detection algorithms
- Protection mechanisms adapt based on the global threat landscape

## Enterprise Customization

Enterprise customers can enhance their DDoS protection with:

- **Custom Sensitivity Levels**: Adjust protection thresholds per environment
- **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed attack reports and traffic analysis
- **Custom Rule Configuration**: Tailor protection to specific traffic patterns
