Deploy only when tags are pushed for controlled releases.

```yaml title="bitbucket-pipelines.yml"
image: node:20

pipelines:
  tags:
    v*:
      - step:
          name: Deploy Release
          script:
            - npm install
            - npx zuplo deploy --api-key "$ZUPLO_API_KEY" --environment
              "$BITBUCKET_TAG"
```

This pipeline triggers only on tags matching `v*` (like `v1.0.0`) and creates an
environment named after the tag.
