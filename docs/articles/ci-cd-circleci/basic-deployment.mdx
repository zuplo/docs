The simplest workflow deploys your API to Zuplo on every push to main.

```yaml title=".circleci/config.yml"
version: 2.1

jobs:
  deploy:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:20.0
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: npm install
      - run: npx zuplo deploy --api-key "$ZUPLO_API_KEY"

workflows:
  deploy:
    jobs:
      - deploy:
          filters:
            branches:
              only: main
```

Store `ZUPLO_API_KEY` in **Project Settings** > **Environment Variables**.

## Next Steps

- Add [automated testing](./deploy-and-test.mdx) after deployment
- Set up [PR preview environments](./pr-preview-environments.mdx)
