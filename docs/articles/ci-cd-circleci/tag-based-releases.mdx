Deploy only when tags are pushed for controlled releases.

```yaml title=".circleci/config.yml"
version: 2.1

jobs:
  deploy:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:20.0
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: npm install
      - run:
          npx zuplo deploy --api-key "$ZUPLO_API_KEY" --environment
          "$CIRCLE_TAG"

workflows:
  release:
    jobs:
      - deploy:
          filters:
            tags:
              only: /^v.*/
            branches:
              ignore: /.*/
```

This workflow triggers only on tags matching `v*` (like `v1.0.0`) and creates an
environment named after the tag.

## Next Steps
