Your place or ours; Zuplo has a variety of hosting options to suit your needs.

## 1. Managed Edge

Here run your Zuplo projects in a serverless environment at the edge (300+ data
centers worldwide). This is our most popular option, if you use our self-serve
product and pay with your credit card this is the option you are choosing. This
option is also popular with Enterprise clients where we handle many Billions of
requests per month and scale up to 100,000s of requests per second effortlessly.

## 2. Managed Dedicated

We run your gateway in a dedicated, isolated VPC on AWS, GCP, Azure, Equinix,
TerraSwitch etc. You get to choose the regions you want your service hosted to
meet any sovereignty or data concerns.

We can support private networking options like AWS PrivateLink, Azure Private
Link, GCP Private Service Connect; available for both inbound and outbound
connections.

## 3. Self-hosted (AKA on-prem)

You get to run Zuplo on your own infrastructure in any cloud or private
data-center. Available as a hybrid option with the use of shared services for
rate-limiting or full self-host. You can deploy Zuplo to any management or
hosting environment such as Kubernetes, Nomad, VMs, Containers etc.
