Your place or ours; Zuplo has a variety of hosting options to suit your needs.

## 1. Managed Edge

Run your Zuplo projects in a serverless environment at the edge across 300+ data
centers worldwide. This is our most popular option and the default choice for
all Zuplo projects. If you use our self-serve product and pay with your credit
card, this is the option you are using.

Managed Edge is ideal for organizations that want:

- The simplest deployment experience with zero infrastructure management
- Global distribution and low-latency performance for users worldwide
- Automatic scaling to handle traffic spikes and high request volumes
- Enterprise-grade performance proven at scale (billions of requests per month,
  millions of requests per second)

For more information, see the
[Managed Edge documentation](/docs/managed-edge/overview).

## 2. Managed Dedicated

We run your gateway in a dedicated, isolated VPC on the cloud provider of your
choice, including Akamai Connected Cloud, AWS, GCP, Azure, Equinix, TerraSwitch,
and more. You get to choose the regions where you want your service hosted to
meet any sovereignty or data residency concerns.

Managed Dedicated is ideal for organizations that need:

- To run your API Gateway on a specific cloud provider
- Custom networking configurations, such as restricting access to the public
  internet
- Geographical deployment requirements where Managed Edge isn't feasible
- Regulatory or compliance requirements that necessitate a dedicated instance
- Private networking options like AWS PrivateLink, Azure Private Link, or GCP
  Private Service Connect (available for both inbound and outbound connections)

For more information, see the
[Managed Dedicated documentation](/docs/dedicated/overview.mdx) or

## 3. Self-Hosted (On-Premises)

Run Zuplo on your own infrastructure in any cloud or private data center using
Kubernetes. Zuplo Self-Hosted runs exclusively on Kubernetes and can be deployed
to any Kubernetes environment. Deployment is simple and uses Helm charts.

Self-Hosted is available in two deployment models:

- **Hybrid Deployment**: Run the Zuplo API Gateway on your Kubernetes cluster
  while leveraging shared services for features such as rate limiting
- **Full Self-Hosted**: Run all Zuplo components on your Kubernetes cluster for
  complete control and isolation

Self-Hosted is ideal for organizations that need:

- Complete control over your infrastructure and deployment environment
- To run Zuplo in a private data center or on-premises Kubernetes environment
- To meet strict data sovereignty or regulatory requirements
- To integrate with existing on-premises systems and networks
- To customize the deployment architecture to match your specific requirements
