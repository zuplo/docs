You can debug your local gateway through VS Code using its TypeScript debugger.
Features such as breakpoints, stepping through the code, variable inspection,
etc will be available to help you debug your gateway.

1. Create a `.vscode/launch.json` file with the following content. If you
   already have an older/existing `.vscode/launch.json` file, you can add the
   section in the curly braces to the configurations array. Take note of the
   port value since that's the value you will specify next.

```json
{
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Zuplo Gateway",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "attach",
      "restart": true,
      "port": 9229
    }
  ]
}
```

2. Start the gateway in debug mode using the port that you specified above.

```bash
npx zuplo dev --debug-port 9229
```

3. Switch to the View > Run and Debug in VS Code. You can now attach the
   debugger by selecting **Zuplo Gateway** and clicking the green triangle.

## Limitations

- We only support stepping through your own module code. System code provided by
  Zuplo are minified and stripped of source maps, so you won't be able to step
  through them.
