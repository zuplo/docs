title: Testing API Key Authentication
---

When running tests there are several ways you might want to handle API Key
authentication. This document outlines a few strategies for testing with API Key
authentication both locally and in deployed environments.

## Testing Locally

When running API key Authentication locally, if you
[link the project](/docs/cli/local-development) to an project the same API Key
The same bucket will be shared by both your development (working copy)
environment and local development.

## Setting the API Key Bucket Name

Either locally or in CI/CD you can specify any API Key Bucket on the
[API Key Authentication](/docs/policies/api-key-inbound) policy by setting the
`bucketName` property. This allows using a consistent API Key Bucket that is
setup with consumers, etc. as required for testing. You can use the
[Zuplo Developer API](https://dev.zuplo.com) to
[create and manage buckets](/docs/articles/api-key-management), consumers, keys,
etc.

## Selectively Disabling

Be extremely careful using this strategy. If configured incorrectly this could
leave your API open to unauthorized access.

Another option is to disable authentication on endpoints for testing purposes.
One way of doing this is to configure the
[API Key Authentication](/docs/policies/api-key-inbound) policy to allow
unauthenticated requests through. This can be done by setting
`allowUnauthenticatedRequests` to true.

In order to enforce authentication with this setting disabled, you can create a
policy that comes after that selectively enforces auth based on some condition.

For example, an environment variable flag could be used to disable auth with the
following policy.

```ts
import {
  ZuploContext,
  ZuploRequest,
  environment,
  HttpProblems,
} from "@zuplo/runtime";

export default async function enforceAuth(
  request: ZuploRequest,
  context: ZuploContext,
) {
  if (environment.DISABLE_AUTH === "AUTH_DISABLED") {
    return request;
  }

  if (!request.user) {
    return HttpProblems.unauthorized(request, context);
  }

  return request;
}
```
