You can install packages from npm to use in your Zuplo Gateway, but bear in mind
these might not work in the cloud (i.e. working-copy and edge environments), as
Zuplo for security reasons does not allow all packages to be installed. Consult
https://zuplo.com/docs/articles/node-modules for the official list of supported
modules.

As of January 2024, we are looking into ways to support bringing in your own
modules. We are proceeding carefully as we want to ensure that we can provide a
secure and reliable experience for our users.
