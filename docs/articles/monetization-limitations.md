title: Limitations
---

Zuplo strives to deliver the most complete, flexible, and intuitive API
monetization system. Given the multitude of different pricing models and their
various configurations - we unfortunately have limited support for certain
features you may want for your monetization model. If the current offering does
not currently suit your needs, please
[reach out](mailto:support@zuplo.com?subject=Monetization%20Inquiry) and we can
expedite work on it.

## Pricing Models & Subscription Cadence

We exclusively support monthly subscription plans. We do not currently support
usage-based billing, annual subscriptions, or other pricing models. Please
[contact us](mailto:support@zuplo.com?subject=Monetization%20Inquiry) if you
need a different pricing model.

## Pricing Table & Checkout Page

The pricing table and checkout pages currently do not respect the "payment
settings" configuration values in Stripe (ex. tax collection, promo codes).

## Updating Meters

A plan's meters can only be updated if there are no subscriptions using it.
