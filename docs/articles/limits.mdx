## HTTP connections

In Zuplo's managed edge environment, HTTP connections have timeouts to ensure
efficient use of resources. These timeouts apply to both incoming connections
from clients to Zuplo and outgoing connections from Zuplo to your origin
servers.

## Between client and Zuplo

| Type                           | Limit (seconds) | HTTP status code at limit |
| ------------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| Connection Keep-Alive HTTP/1.1 | 400             | TCP connection closed     |
| Connection Idle HTTP/2         | 400             | TCP connection closed     |

## Between Zuplo and origin server

| Type                    | Limit (seconds) | HTTP status code at limit |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| Complete TCP Connection | 19              | 522                       |
| TCP ACK Timeout         | 90              | 522                       |
| TCP Keep-Alive Interval | 30              | 520                       |
| Proxy Idle Timeout      | 900             | 520                       |
| Proxy Read Timeout      | 180             | 524                       |
| Proxy Write Timeout     | 30              | 524                       |
| HTTP/2 Pings to Origin  | Off             | -                         |
| HTTP/2 Connection Idle  | 900             | No                        |

## API keys

### Consumers & keys

Zuplo doesn't impose a hard cap on the number of consumers or keys you can
create. However, usage of the service is subject to "fair use" policies meaning
if your usage is deemed excessive we may limit usage. If you require specific
limits please contact sales to discuss pricing plans.

Our general guidelines for what constitutes fair use are as follows:

- Free Plan: 500 consumers or keys
- Builder Plan: 1,000 consumers or keys
- Enterprise Plan: Custom

### Consumer metadata and tags

- Consumer `metadata` - The JSON encoded object can't be larger than 1kb.
- Consumer `tags` - Each consumer is limited to 5 key value pair tags.

### API key management operations

Requests to API key management operations on the Zuplo Developer API
(dev.zuplo.com) are limited to 100 requests per second.

### API key authorizations

One API key authorization can be made per request. Enterprise plans can request
custom limits to allow multiple API key authorizations per request.

### Cache

The [cache API](../programmable-api/cache.mdx) and abstractions on top of it
such as [ZoneCache](../programmable-api/zone-cache.mdx) have the following
limits:

- Maximum size per cached item: 512 MB
- Maximum cache calls per request: 1000
