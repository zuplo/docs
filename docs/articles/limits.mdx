## API Keys

### Consumers & Keys

Zuplo doesn't impose a hard cap on the number of consumers or keys you can
create. However, usage of the service is subject to "fair use" policies meaning
if your usage is deemed excessive we may limit usage. If you require specific
limits please contact sales to discuss pricing plans.

Our general guidelines for what constitutes fair use are as follows:

- Free Plan: 500 consumers or keys
- Builder Plan: 1,000 consumers or keys
- Enterprise Plan: Custom

### Consumer Metadata and Tags

- Consumer `metadata` - The JSON encoded object can't be larger than 1kb.
- Consumer `tags` - Each consumer is limited to 5 key value pair tags.

### API Key Management Operations

Requests to API Key Management operations on the Zuplo Developer API
(dev.zuplo.com) are limited to 100 requests per second.

### API key authorizations

One API key authorization can be made per request. Enterprise plans can request
custom limits to allow multiple API key authorizations per request.
