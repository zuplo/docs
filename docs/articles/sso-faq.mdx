This document explains some common questions about Zuplo's Enterprise Single
Sign-On offerings.

## What SSO Providers does Zuplo Support?

Zuplo uses Auth0 to manage enterprise SSO, so we can support essentially any SSO
provider required. Common options are Azure AD, Okta, Google Workspace, etc.

## What happens when SSO is enabled for my organization?

When SSO is enabled, you'll use your organization's identity provider (like Okta
or Azure AD) to log into Zuplo. This provides enhanced security and streamlines
access management for your team.

If you previously had a Zuplo account with the same email address, your SSO
login will be treated as the primary method going forward.

## Will I have access to my existing projects after SSO is enabled?

Yes! When you log in with SSO using the same email address as your previous
account, you'll automatically have access to all the projects and roles from
your existing Zuplo accounts. The system will seamlessly connect your SSO
identity with your previous access permissions.

## How should I log into Zuplo once SSO is enabled?

Always use the standard Zuplo login page at https://portal.zuplo.com - the
system will automatically redirect you to your organization's SSO provider. This
ensures you're using the secure, organization-approved authentication method.
