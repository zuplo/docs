title: Custom CORS policies
---

There are two built-in CORS policies called `none` and `anything-goes`. The
former disallows any cross-origin access while the latter allows any
cross-origin access (and is discouraged for production use cases). To correctly
support CORS we recommend creating and using a custom CORS policy.

## CORS Policy

Custom CORS policies are created in the policies.json file alongside regular
policies:

```json
{
  "policies": [], //...
  "corsPolicies": [] // custom CORS policies go here
}
```

A CORS policy consists of a name and set of CORS headers to be returned for
cross-origin requests (both the simple type and pre-flight request).

:::warning

Make sure to not have a trailing `/` on your allowedOrigins. e.g.
`https://example.com` is valid, `https://example.com/` will not work.

:::

```json
{
  //... rest of policies.json file
  "corsPolicies": [
    {
      "name": "custom-cors",
      "allowedOrigins": "https://domain1.com, https://domain2.com",
      "allowedHeaders": "origin, my-special-incoming-header",
      "allowedMethods": ["GET", "POST"],
      "exposeHeaders": "my-special-response-header",
      "maxAge": 600,
      "allowCredentials": true
    }
  ]
}
```

:::note

You can specify a list of supported domains. Zuplo will ensure the pre-flight
request is compatible with browsers by filtering the list to match the incoming
origin, provided it is in your list of origins.

:::

You can then reference your custom CORS policy in your route by specifying the
name of your CORS policy on your route, (or choosing it in the route designer
UI).

```json
"paths": {
  "/redirect-test": {
    "get": {
      "x-zuplo-route": {
        "corsPolicy": "custom-cors",
        "handler": {
          "module": "$import(@zuplo/runtime)",
          "export": "redirectHandler",
          "options": {
            "location": "/docs"
          }
        }
      },
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

## Using environment variables

If you need to support different origins, headers, etc. in different
environments, you can use environment variables

```json
{
  //... rest of policies.json file
  "corsPolicies": [
    {
      "name": "custom-cors",
      "allowedOrigins": "$env(ALLOWED_ORIGINS)", // "https://domain1.com, https://domain2.com",
      "allowedHeaders": "$env(ALLOWED_HEADERS)", // "origin, my-special-incoming-header",
      "allowedMethods": ["GET", "POST"],
      "exposeHeaders": "my-special-response-header",
      "maxAge": 600,
      "allowCredentials": true
    }
  ]
}
```
