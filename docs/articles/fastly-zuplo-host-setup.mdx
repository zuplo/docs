This document outlines how to use Zuplo as a host for Fastly. While this isn't a
necessary setup for most people as Zuplo already runs at the edge and can be
used for CDN like caching. However, there are some scenarios where you may want
to put Zuplo behind Fastly. For example, if you are using Fastly's
[WAF or DDoS protection](./waf-ddos-fastly.mdx) and want to ensure that all
traffic goes through Fastly before hitting your Zuplo API Gateway.

## Configuring Zuplo as a Fastly Host

The following settings will allow you to run Zuplo as a host behind Fastly.

### Zuplo Configuration

It's recommended that you use a custom domain for your Zuplo API Gateway. This
will allow you to more configure your Fastly host as well as ensure that your
domain is stable regardless of your Zuplo configuration.

### Fastly Configuration

1. Create a new Fastly CDN service or use an existing one.
2. Create a new Origin and name it whatever you like.
3. Set the **Address** to your Zuplo API Gateway domain. For example,
   `api.example.com` if using a custom domain, or
   `my-project-main-021839d.zuplo.app` without a custom domain.
4. Enable TLS and keep the port as `443`.
5. Select Yes on Verify the Certificate.
6. If using a custom domain, set the _Certificate Hostname_ to your custom
   domain. If using a `zuplo.app` domain, set the set the _Certificate Hostname_
   to `zuplo.app`.
7. Set the **SNI hostname** to your custom domain or full `zuplo.app` domain
   (for example, `my-project-main-021839d.zuplo.app`)
8. Set the **Override Host** to your custom domain or full `zuplo.app` domain
   (for example, `my-project-main-021839d.zuplo.app`)

Additional settings like mTLS are also supported. Please refer to the Fastly
documentation for more information.
