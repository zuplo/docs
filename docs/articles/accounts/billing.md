The "Upgrade & Billing" page in the Zuplo dashboard allows you to subscribe to a
Zuplo plan, update your payment method, and view your billing history.

Zuplo uses Stripe to process payments. When you subscribe to a Zuplo plan, you
will be redirected to the Stripe checkout page to enter your payment
information. Once your payment is processed, you will be redirected back to the
Zuplo dashboard.

## Update Payment Method

When you navigate to the "Upgrade & Billing" page, you will see a link to manage
your existing subscription. Clicking this link will take you to the Stripe
checkout page where you can update your payment method.

::: note Enterprise Plans

Enterprise plans are setup with custom billing and cannot be managed through the
portal. Contact your account representative for questions or assistance.
