The "Upgrade & Billing" page in the Zuplo dashboard allows you to subscribe to a
Zuplo plan, update your payment method, and view your billing history.

Zuplo uses Stripe to process payments. When you subscribe to a Zuplo plan, you
will be redirected to the Stripe checkout page to enter your payment
information. Once your payment is processed, you will be redirected back to the
Zuplo dashboard.

## Update Payment Method

When you navigate to the "Upgrade & Billing" page, you will see a link to manage
your existing subscription. Clicking this link will take you to the Stripe
checkout page where you can update your payment method.

Enterprise plans are setup with custom billing and can't be managed through the
portal. Contact your account representative for questions or assistance.
