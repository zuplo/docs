<EnterpriseFeature name="Audit Logs" />

Audit logs provide a comprehensive record of activities within your Zuplo
account, helping you track changes and maintain compliance requirements. Every
change performed in your account is logged with detailed information about who
performed the change, when it occurred, and what resources were affected.

:::note{title="Beta Feature"}

Audit logs are currently in beta. During the beta period not all events may be
captured. We are working towards full coverage.

:::

## Overview

Audit logs capture critical events across your Zuplo infrastructure, including:

- Project and environment modifications
- Configuration changes
- Team member management
- API key operations
- Deployment activities
- Security-related actions

Each log entry provides complete visibility into the change performed, making it
easy to investigate issues, track changes, and demonstrate compliance.

## Accessing Audit Logs

Audit logs are available for accounts on the Enterprise plan. To access your
audit logs:

1. Navigate to your account settings
2. Click on **Audit Logs** in the left sidebar
3. View the chronological list of all account activities

:::note

Audit logs are retained for 90 days by default. Contact support if you need
extended retention periods.

### Retention and Archival

- Understand your compliance requirements for log retention
- Plan for long-term storage if needed beyond 90 days
- Consider exporting logs for archival purposes
- Maintain backup copies of critical audit trails

## Limitations

- Audit logs are retained for 90 days by default
- Maximum of 100 results per API request
- Date range queries cannot exceed 30 days
- Some automated system actions may not generate audit logs
- Logs are immutable and cannot be modified or deleted
