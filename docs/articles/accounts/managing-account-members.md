Accounts can be shared with many users. This document explains how to add and
manage users in your account.

To start, navigate to the account settings page by clicking on your user icon in
the top right corner of the screen and selecting "Settings" from the dropdown
menu.

The view will display the users that are currently members of the account and
their roles.

On the top of the page, you can enter an email address of the user you want to
invite. For accounts with the enterprise role feature, users are added to the
account with the role of "Member", for all other accounts users are added with
the role of "Admin".

![Invite User](../../../public/media/managing-account-members/image-1.png)

After inviting a user, you will see the invited user in the list with the
members.

the role from the drop down.

Roles are available as a paid add-on as part of enterprise plans. For plans
without this feature, users are always set to the "Admin" role. For more
