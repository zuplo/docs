title: Managing Project Members
sidebar_label: Project Members

Projects can have multiple members with different roles. Some account level
roles allow access to project resources as well. Users can also be assigned
project level roles in order to grant them access to specific project resources.

To manage project members, navigate to the project settings page and click on
the "Members" tab. Here you can see a list of all members in the project and
their roles.

![Project Members](../../../public/media/managing-project-members/image-1.png)

This list will display all account members - even those who have no access to
the project.

Account admins will always have access to all projects. If you try to change the
role of an account admin, you will see a warning message that this user is an
account admin and cannot be changed.

For users who are not account admins, you can change their role by selecting the
desired role from the dropdown.

:::info Paid Add-on

Roles are available as a paid add-on as part of enterprise plans. For plans
without this feature, all account members will have access to all projects. For
more information contact [sales@zuplo.com](mailto:sales@zuplo.com).

drop down.
