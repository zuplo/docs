Accounts in Zuplo can have multiple members with different roles. The role of
each member defines the permissions they have in the account.

Projects in Zuplo can also have multiple members with different roles. Some
account level roles allow access to project resources as well. Users can also be
assigned project level roles in order to grant them access to specific project
resources.
