## Changing the port numbers

By default the Zuplo local server runs on port 9000 and route designer runs on
port 9100. To change the port number, you can call

```sh
npx zuplo dev --port <port number> --editor-port <editor port number>
```

## Certificates Errors

When running Zuplo locally you may want to call a service with a self-signed
certificate. By default this isn't supported - we recommend using signed/trusted
certicates in deployed environments. However, for local development you can
ignore certificate errors by adding the `--unsafely-ignore-certificate-errors`
flag on the `zuplo dev` command.

Run your development server with the following command:

```bash
npx zuplo dev --unsafely-ignore-certificate-errors
```

If you want to update your `package.json` to always allow self-signed
certificates, you can add the following script:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "zuplo dev --unsafely-ignore-certificate-errors"
  }
}
```

## Updating the Zuplo CLI

To update the CLI, run the following command in your project directory.

```bash
npm install zuplo@latest
```

You must include the @latest to ensure you are getting the latest. Otherwise,
you could have an older version cached locally on your machine.

You can compare if you have the latest version by looking at the version number
on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zuplo?activeTab=versions)
