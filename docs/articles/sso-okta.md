Zuplo uses Auth0 to enable Okta SSO for enterprise accounts who have purchased
single-sign-on. Below you will find instructions on how to setup Okta to be used
with Zuplo.

1. First, you will need to
   [create a new application in Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/aspnet/create-okta-application/).
   Record the client ID and client secret values to share with Zuplo.

   - The application type should be "Web application".
   - The **Redirect URI** value should be set to
     `https://auth.zuplo.com/login/callback`
   - The trusted origin should be set to `https://auth.zuplo.com`
   - No special permissions are needed. Zuplo only requires basic profile
     information (name and email).

2. Securely share the following values with Zuplo.

| Field                     | Description                                                                                                                                                              |

| Client ID                 | Unique identifier for your registered Okta application.                                                                                                                  |
| Client Secret             | String used to gain access to your registered Okta application.                                                                                                          |
| Okta Domain               | Okta's domain name for your organization.                                                                                                                                |
