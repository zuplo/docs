title: Policy Fundamentals

Policies are modules that can intercept an incoming request or outgoing
response. You can have multiple policies and apply them to multiple routes.
There are built-in policies but of course, being a developer-focused platform
you can easily create custom policies.

## How policies work

![How Policies Work](../../public/media/policies/103f37f8-9801-4f37-8962-d516b9e12fbd.png)

An `inbound` policy can intercept a request and modify the request before it
reaches the request handler (or the next policy). It can also short-circuit the
whole request lifecycle and immediately respond to the client.

An `outbound` policy intercepts the response from your request handler, allowing
you to transform your response, or return a new one entirely.

## Built-In Policies

Zuplo includes many built-in policies that make it easy to handle things like
authentication, validation, and request modification.

Explore the navigation to see all of the built-in policies.

## Custom Policies

The ability to write custom policies that run in-process of your Gateway is at
the core of what makes Zuplo the Programmable API Gateway. You can write
policies to handle virtually any task. To learn more about
[writing custom policies see the documentation](../policies/custom-code-inbound.mdx).
