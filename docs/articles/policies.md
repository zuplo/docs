Policies are modules that can intercept an incoming request. You can have
multiple policies and apply them to multiple routes. There are built-in policies
but of course, being a developer-focused platform you can easily create custom
policies.

## How policies work

![How Policies Work](https://cdn.zuplo.com/assets/103f37f8-9801-4f37-8962-d516b9e12fbd.png)

A policy can intercept a request and modify the request before it reaches the
request handler (and the next policy). It can also short-circuit the whole
request lifecycle and immediately respond to the client.

## Built-In Policies

Zuplo includes many built-in policies that make it easy to handle things like
authentication, validation, and request modification.

Explore the navigation to see all of the built-in policies.

## Custom Policies

The ability to write custom policies that run in-process of your Gateway is at
the core of what makes Zuplo the Programmable API Gateway. You can write
policies to handle virtually any task. To learn more about
[writing custom policies see the documentation](/docs/policies/custom-code-inbound).
