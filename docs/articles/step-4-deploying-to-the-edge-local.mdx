In this guide we'll show you how to deploy your gateway to the edge, at over 300
data-centers around the world. The act of deployment creates new
[environments](./environments) and it's worth familiarizing yourself with
[how environments work](./environments).

In this tutorial we'll show the default workflow via GitHub, but note that we
also support GitLab, BitBucket
([enterprise plan only](https://zuplo.com/pricing)) and
[custom CI/CD](./custom-ci-cd).

To follow this tutorial you'll need

- a GitHub account (it's free, sign up at [github.com](https://github.com)).
- a zuplo project - complete [Step 1](./step-1-setup-basic-gateway.mdx),
  [Step 2](./step-2-add-rate-limiting.mdx) and
  [Step 3](./step-3-add-api-key-auth.mdx) for a great start!
- to install the
  [Zuplo GitHub deployment](https://github.com/apps/zuplo/installations/new) to
  GitHub - you can
  [follow these instructions](https://github.com/apps/zuplo/installations/new)

Let's get started:

<Stepper>

1. Authorize to GitHub

   Next, go to your project in the Zuplo portal and open to the **Settings**
   tab, then select **Source Control**. Control. If your project isn't already
   connected to GitHub click the **Connect to GitHub** button and follow the
   auth flow. You'll need to grant permissions for any GitHub organizations you
   want to work with.

   ![Connect GitHub](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/image-1.png)

   Next, a dialog will open asking you to authorize Zuplo. Click the **Authorize
   Zuplo** button.

   ![Zuplo GitHub connection](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/d6194a80-b6d6-429e-85a6-ae1cb4a3375e.png)

   </Framed>

   <Callout type="tip" title="GitHub Permissions" >

   The permission "Act on your behalf" sounds a bit scary - however, this is a
   standard GitHub permission and by default Zuplo can't actually do anything
   with this. In order to perform actions on your behalf you must grant Zuplo
   access to a specific repository (shown in the next steps.).

   [read more about this permission on GitHub's docs](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/authorizing-github-apps#about-github-apps-acting-on-your-behalf).

   </Callout>

   After you have connected the GitHub app, it needs to be granted permission to
   edit a repository. If this is your first time connecting Zuplo, you will be
   immediately asked to select a GitHub Org to install Zuplo. Select the org you
   want to use.

   <Framed size="sm">

   </Framed>

   Next, you will be asked to select the repositories that you want Zuplo to
   access. The easiest thing is to just select **All Repositories**, but if you
   want fine-grain control, you can select a specific repository.

   <Framed size="sm">

   ![Choosing repository to install](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/ff482269-9aa2-44c3-8266-b2682b3d6ea5.png)

   </Framed>

   <Callout type="caution" title="Existing Installation" >

   The next step is only if you already have Zuplo installed in a GitHub org and
   need to add another organization.

   </Callout>

   If you weren't prompted to select a GitHub org, it's likely that you are
   already a member of an account that has authorized Zuplo. To add Zuplo to a
   new organization click **Add GitHub Account** in the org picker list.

   ![Connect Org](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/image-2.png)

1. Connect GitHub to your Project

   With your GitHub App configured, you can now return to the Zuplo portal. In
   the **Source Control** settings you should now see a list of GitHub
   repositories. Create a new repository by clicking the **Create new
   repository** button. You will be prompted that this will open GitHub. Click
   to continue.

   ![Create Repository](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/image-3.png)

   In the GitHub UI, you can rename your repository if you want. Click the
   **Create repository** button at the bottom of the page and return to the
   Zuplo Portal.

   The portal will reload and you will see your new repository listed. Click
   **Connect** to connect Zuplo to that repository.

   ![Connect](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/image-4.png)

   After the connection succeeds you will see a link to your GitHub repository.

   ![Connected Repository](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/image-5.png)

   Click the link to return to GitHub. You should see a little brown dot next to
   the commit hash (1). When you hover your mouse over that you'll see the Zuplo
   deployment was successful. Click **Details** (2) to open the deployment info.

   This shows that your deployment is in progress, it will take about 50
   seconds.

   ![Zuplo deployment run](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/brown-dot.png)

   On the deployment page, you will see **Deployment has Completed!!** and below
   that's the link to your new environment.

   ![Zuplo deployment run result](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/26fa58b6-7a5a-4627-bd9f-246972639f12.png)

1. Deploy another Environment

   Zuplo makes it easy for teams to collaborate by allowing teams to create many
   preview environments. To create a new environment, simple go to your
   repository in GitHub and create a new branch.

   Let's create a branch called `development`

   ![Create new branch](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/60cdeb36-ab7d-42f9-a8c2-1f7931f80ca6.png)

   Wait about 20s and head back to Zuplo - you should see a new entry in the
   environment dropdown called `development`.

1. Push a Change to 'development'

   Let's make a simple change to our `working-copy` environment. Let's do
   something simple like capitalize the **Summary** field from 'Get all todos'
   to 'Get All Todos'. It doesn't really matter what the change is.

   ![Changes Summary](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/image-6.png)

   Save your changes. Click the GitHub button at bottom left and choose **Commit
   & Push**.

   ![Commit & Push](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/image-7.png)

   Enter a description of your change in the dialog that pops up:

   <ModalScreenshot>

   ![Change Summary](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/image-8.png)

   </ModalScreenshot>

   Click **Commit & Push** will create a new temporary branch in GitHub with a
   name `zup-...`. On the next dialog, click **Create Pull Request**.

   <ModalScreenshot>

   ![Create PR](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/image-9.png)

   </ModalScreenshot>

   This will navigate you to the screen in GitHub that allows you to create a
   Pull Request. Change the **base** branch to `development` (since that's the
   environment we want to update first). Click **Create pull request**.

   ![GitHub PR](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/875b164d-b7ef-4f46-9cdb-8d59354b5b93.png)

   When ready, click **Merge pull request**.

   ![Merge PR](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/e8c68072-35dc-462a-8161-7a44e40fa1df.png)

   Once merged, you'll want to delete that temporary branch.

   ![Delete branch](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/51a25aa0-cdce-4112-ba2e-e56f42a9044d.png)

   The successful merge will trigger a rebuild and deployment of `development`
   with your change. You can check this by choosing the environment
   `development` in Zuplo and navigating to the **read only** Route Designer.

   ![Navigating Environments](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/image.png)

   This shows how you can use widely recognized GitOps practices to manage how
   code flows through your environments using Pull Requests and protected
   branches.

## Troubleshooting

I don't see my repository listed in Zuplo project settings.

- Make sure you've granted access to the project with the Zuplo GitHub App, you
  can
  [check that configuration here](https://github.com/apps/zuplo/installations/new)

I've connected my Zuplo project to a GitHub repository but get access errors
when running commits, pulls or try to open a pull request.

- If you are the owner of the project, make sure you've granted access to the
  project with the Zuplo GitHub App, you can
  [check that configuration here](https://github.com/apps/zuplo/installations/new)
- If this Zuplo project was shared with you, make sure you are a GitHub
  collaborator. This can be verified by going to the GitHub repository >
  Settings > Collaborators section. You'll need admin permissions to the
  repository.
- If the GitHub repository has been renamed or moved to a different
  organization, try disconnecting and reconnecting to it. You can do this by
  going to your Zuplo project's settings > Source Control section
