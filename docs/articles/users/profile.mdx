Your user profile is set automatically by your identity provider when you sign
in to your Zuplo account. To set your profile picture, name, and email address,
you must update your profile in your identity provider. Zuplo doesn't control
this information, and it's not stored in Zuplo.

If you are authenticating with a username and password, you won't have a profile
picture or name. Currently, Zuplo doesn't support setting a profile picture or
name for accounts that authenticate with a username and password.
