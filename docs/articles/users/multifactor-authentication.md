Zuplo supports multifactor authentication (MFA) to help keep your account
secure. MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of
verification in addition to your password. This can be done using an
authenticator app or security keys.

To enable multifactor authentication for your account, follow these steps:

1. Follow the instructions to set up your chosen method of multifactor
   authentication.

   verification in addition.

**Multifactor Authentication** section of your user profile and click
