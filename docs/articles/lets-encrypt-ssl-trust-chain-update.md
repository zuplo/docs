title: Let's Encrypt SSL Trust Chain Update
---

Let’s Encrypt, one of the certificate authorities (CAs) used by Zuplo, has
[announced changes to its chain of trust](https://letsencrypt.org/2023/07/10/cross-sign-expiration).
As a result, certain legacy clients, such as those using Android 7.0, will no
longer support SSL certificates issued by Let’s Encrypt.

:::tip

This change will only impact a very small number of clients. Across all Zuplo
APIs, less than 1 request per several billion in the past 30 days have been made
by clients that may be impacted by this change.

:::

Customers who are impacted by this change have been notified directly. If you
received a notice, please follow the instructions below.

If no action is taken, your domain’s Let’s Encrypt certificate will continue to
be used and will be reissued on September 9th. This could prevent legacy clients
from connecting to your API.

If you wish to continue supporting these legacy clients, please contact
[support@zuplo.com](mailto:support@zuplo.com). We can assist you in switching to
a different Certificate Authority (Google Trust Services), which offers broader
device support.

## Impacted Legacy Clients

The primary clients impacted by this change are those using Android 7.0 or
earlier. These Android releases came out before 2016 and are no longer supported
by Google. The vast majority of Android devices are on much newer versions.
