Connect your Zuplo project to GitHub for source control and automatic
deployments. Every push to your repository deploys automatically — no CI/CD
configuration required.

## Connect Your Project to GitHub

This guide assumes you have a Zuplo project created. If you don't have one yet,
follow the steps in
[Step 1 - Setup a Basic Gateway](./step-1-setup-basic-gateway.mdx) to create a
new Zuplo project.

<Stepper>

1. Connect to GitHub

   Go to your project in the Zuplo portal and open to the **Settings** tab, then
   select **Source Control**. If your project isn't already connected to GitHub
   click the **Connect to GitHub** button and follow the auth flow. You'll need
   to grant permissions for any GitHub organizations you want to work with.

1. **Authorize Zuplo**

   A dialog will open asking you to authorize Zuplo. Click the **Authorize
   Zuplo** button.

   :::tip{title="GitHub Permissions"}

   The permission "Act on your behalf" sounds a bit scary - however, this is a
   standard GitHub permission and by default Zuplo can't actually do anything
   with this. In order to perform actions on your behalf you must grant Zuplo
   access to a specific repository (shown in the next steps).

   You can
   [read more about this permission on GitHub's docs](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/authorizing-github-apps#about-github-apps-acting-on-your-behalf).

   :::

1. **Select a GitHub organization**

   After you have connected the GitHub app, it needs to be granted permission to
   edit a repository. If this is your first time connecting Zuplo, you will be
   immediately asked to select a GitHub Org to install Zuplo. Select the org you
   want to use.

   </Framed>

1. **Select repositories**

   You will be asked to select the repositories that you want Zuplo to access.
   The easiest thing is to just select **All Repositories**, but if you want
   fine-grain control, you can select a specific repository.

   :::caution{title="Existing Installation"}

   If you weren't prompted to select a GitHub org, it's likely that you are
   already a member of an account that has authorized Zuplo. To add Zuplo to a
   new organization click **Add GitHub Account** in the org picker list.

   :::

1. **Create a repository**

   With your GitHub App configured, return to the Zuplo portal. In the **Source
   Control** settings you should now see a list of GitHub repositories. Create a
   new repository by clicking the **Create new repository** button. You will be
   prompted that this will open GitHub. Click to continue.

   ![Create Repository](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/image-3.png)

   In the GitHub UI, you can rename your repository if you want. Click the
   **Create repository** button at the bottom of the page and return to the
   Zuplo Portal.

1. **Connect your repository**

   The portal will reload and you will see your new repository listed. Click
   **Connect** to connect Zuplo to that repository.

   ![Connect](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/image-4.png)

   After the connection succeeds you will see a link to your GitHub repository.

   ![Connected Repository](../../public/media/step-4-deploying-to-the-edge/image-5.png)

1. **Verify deployment**

   Click the link to return to GitHub. You should see a green check next to the
   commit hash (1). When you hover your mouse over that you'll see the Zuplo
   deployment was successful. Click **Details** (2) to open the deployment info.

   ![Zuplo deployment running](../../public/media/source-control-setup-github/0a9932eb-7c16-49cf-9720-0beb450724eb.png)

   On the deployment page, you will see **Deployment has Completed!!** and below
   that's the link to your new environment.

## Connecting Existing Repositories

If you have an existing GitHub repository that contains a Zuplo project, you can
connect to that repository when you create a new project. Select **Import
existing project** then select your GitHub organization and repository.

## What's Included

With GitHub connected, you get:

- **Automatic deployments** — Every push deploys to Zuplo automatically
- **Branch environments** — Each branch gets its own isolated environment
- **Deployment status** — See deploy results as GitHub checks on commits and PRs
- **Portal sync** — Push and pull changes between the Zuplo portal and GitHub

## Next Steps

- **[Testing Deployments](./github-deployment-testing.mdx)** — Run tests
  automatically after each deploy
- **[Custom GitHub Actions](./custom-ci-cd-github.mdx)** — Advanced workflows
  with approval gates and multi-stage deployments
- **[Branch-Based Deployments](./branch-based-deployments.mdx)** — How branches
  map to environments

## Frequently Asked Questions

<Faq>
  <FaqItem question="What happens if I disconnect my repository?">
    If you disconnect your repository, you can go back to source control
    settings and reconnect it.
  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem question="What happens if I rename my repository?">
    Renaming your repository will break the connection. You must disconnect and
    reconnect to restore the link.
  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem question="Can I connect multiple Zuplo projects to the same repo?">
    No, each Zuplo project must be connected to a unique GitHub repository.
  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem question="My project isn't deploying, what do I do?">
    First, check the deployment status in GitHub. If there is an error message,
    follow the instructions to resolve it. Next, check that the [Zuplo GitHub
    app](https://github.com/apps/zuplo) is installed in your organization and
    has access to the repository where your Zuplo projects are located. If you
    need help, contact Zuplo support.
