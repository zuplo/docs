Zuplo uses Auth0 to enable Azure SSO for enterprise accounts who have purchased
single-sign-on. Below you will find instructions on how to setup a new Azure AD
client to be used with Zuplo.

1. Register a new Application in Azure Active Directory. For instructions on
   this process, see
   [Microsoft's quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app).
   Record the client ID value to share with Zuplo.
   - The application type should be "web".
   - The **Redirect URI** value should be set to
     `https://auth.zuplo.com/login/callback`
   - No special permissions are needed. Zuplo only requires basic profile
     information (name and email).

2. Create a client secret for you application. To create a client secret, see
   Microsoft's Quickstart:
   [Configure a client application to access web APIs - Add Credentials to your web application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app).
   Record this value. You will need to share this securely with Zuplo.

   :::tip

   If you configure an expiring secret, make sure to record the expiration date;
   you will need to renew the key before that day to avoid a service
   interruption.

3. Securely share the following values with Zuplo.
