title: Zuplo + WAF/DDoS Services
---

Many customers using Zuplo (or any other API Gateway) often choose to deploy WAF
and DDoS protection in front of their gateway. You can use any WAF - we have
customers today using Azure, AWS, Akamai, CloudFlare and many other options.

However, there are some things to consider depending on how you host Zuplo
(edge, dedicated, or self-hosted).

If for some reason these don't work for you - we can also offer a managed WAF as
part of your Zuplo Enterprise agreement; contact sales to discuss.

More details on some third-party WAF solutions are included below.

## Managed Edge Deployments

Zuplo when running on the managed edge is running in over 300 data centers
around the world. If you care about worldwide presence, be sure to choose a WAF
that is globally distributed as all traffic will be routed through your WAF.

## Managed Dedicated and Self-hosted Deployments

Customers typically use a WAF offered by their selected hosting platform (e.g.
Azure, Akamai, AWS etc) to simplify management, improve latency and reduce
bandwidth costs.

## Zuplo Managed WAF

Zuplo offers different WAF solutions based on your deployment model:

**Managed Edge Deployment:** Customers on Zuplo's enterprise plans using our
managed edge deployment can use Zuplo Managed WAF. This provides
enterprise-grade protection for your API Gateway with minimal configuration
required, including OWASP Core Ruleset, OFAC sanctions compliance, DDoS
protection, and custom rule capabilities.

**Managed Dedicated Deployment:** Customers using Zuplo's managed dedicated
deployment model can leverage custom WAF and DDoS configurations based on the
capabilities of their chosen cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP). Our team will
work with you to configure the appropriate security services available in your
cloud environment.

For detailed information about Zuplo Managed WAF for managed edge deployments,
see our [Zuplo Managed WAF guide](./zuplo-waf.mdx).

:::tip

Many common WAF functions can be implemented directly in Zuplo using policies,
without the need for a separate WAF service:

- **IP Restriction** - Block or allow requests from specific IP addresses using
  the [IP Restriction policy](../policies/ip-restriction-inbound)
- **Geolocation Blocking** - Route or block requests based on country using
  [custom policies](../guides/geolocation-backend-routing)
- **Rate Limiting** - Protect against abuse with built-in
  [rate limiting policies](../policies/rate-limit-inbound)
- **Custom Rules** - Create any custom security logic with
  [custom code policies](../policies/custom-code-inbound)

These policies run at the edge with your API, ensuring no additional latency
while providing powerful security capabilities.

is right for your deployment model.

## Third-Party WAF Solutions

If you require the ability to finely control your WAF Rules or are using a
third-party WAF provider, Zuplo integrates seamlessly with popular edge-based
WAF solutions.

### Akamai App & API Protector

Akamai's App & API Protector provides comprehensive WAF and DDoS protection with
a global edge network. Akamai offers advanced bot management, API security, and
DDoS mitigation that works well with Zuplo's edge-deployed architecture. With
over 4,000 edge locations worldwide, Akamai ensures minimal latency when
protecting your Zuplo API Gateway.

Key features include:

- Advanced bot detection and mitigation
- API-specific security rules and rate limiting
- Real-time threat intelligence
- Automatic protection against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- DDoS protection across all layers

Akamai's extensive edge network ensures that security checks happen close to
your users, maintaining the low-latency benefits of Zuplo's edge deployment.

### Cloudflare WAF + DDoS

Cloudflare is the easiest solution for custom WAF + DDoS in front of your Zuplo
API Gateway deployed as managed-edge. Because managed-edge is already terminated
with Cloudflare, the integration is seamless and requires virtually zero
configuration. Simply point your Cloudflare managed domain to Zuplo and you are
protected. You can fully customize your WAF, firewall, DDoS or any other
security configuration offered by Cloudflare. When a request comes into
Cloudflare, it will be routed first through your account's configuration, then
will be sent to your Zuplo API Gateway. The same thing happens on the outbound
as well.

A custom domain configured on Zuplo that utilizes Cloudflare DNS is completely
protected from requests bypassing your WAF and hitting Zuplo directly.
Additionally, because your WAF and DDoS are in the same edge locations that
Zuplo uses to terminate our endpoints, there will be no additional latency.

### Fastly Next-Gen WAF (powered by Signal Sciences)

Fastly's next-gen WAF is another good edge-based solution for WAF/DDoS
protection. Fastly can be configured with minimal setup to work with Zuplo.
Because Fastly is most of the same edge locations as Cloudflare (while they
don't disclose this, we suspect that in many cases they're often in the same
physical colo data centers) there will be virtually no additional latency using
the two products together.

### AWS Shield + AWS WAF + Cloudfront

AWS offers DDoS (Shield) and WAF products that run at Cloudfront edge locations.
This is another good option for edge-based WAF/DDoS protection in front of your
Zuplo API Gateway. AWS Cloudfront is also in hundreds of edge locations that are
very close to Cloudflare locations (again, this isn't something either company
discloses, but we suspect there is significant overlap in the physical locations
used by AWS and Cloudflare).
