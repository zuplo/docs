title: Monetization V1 End of Life
sidebar_label: End of Life (Monetization V1)
---

We're announcing the end of life for Zuplo's v1 monetization product. This
decision reflects our commitment to delivering the best possible experience for
API monetization while focusing on what we do best - building the most amazing
API management product.

## Important Timeline

:::danger

**The monetization service will be fully shut down on November 15th, 2025.**

No new projects can be created with the legacy monetization features, effective
immediately.

:::

## Why We Made This Decision

After careful consideration and extensive customer feedback, we've decided to
sunset our v1 monetization product for the following reasons:

### Limited Monetization Strategies

Our v1 monetization product lacked the flexibility many customers needed,
including:

- Pay-as-you-go pricing models
- Credit-based systems
- Usage-based billing with variable pricing tiers
- Custom pricing models for enterprise customers

### Customer Feedback

We heard loud and clear from our customers that they need a complete
monetization solution that includes:

- Comprehensive UI for managing the entire API monetization lifecycle
- Self-service customer portals for subscription management
- Built-in support for upgrades, downgrades, and plan changes
- Streamlined refund and credit management
- Advanced analytics and revenue reporting
- Multi-currency support
- Tax calculation and compliance features

### Focus on Core Strengths

We believe in doing one thing exceptionally well. Zuplo's strength lies in
building the most powerful, developer-friendly API management platform. By
focusing our efforts on API management rather than billing and payments, we can
deliver even more value in our core product.

## Our New Approach: Best of Both Worlds

Instead of building monetization features from scratch, we're partnering with
best-in-class monetization platforms and creating deep integrations, guides, and
samples. This approach gives you:

- **The best API management product** - Zuplo's powerful gateway, developer
  portal, and management features
- **The best monetization products** - Purpose-built billing and metering
  solutions with all the features you need
- **Seamless integration** - Pre-built policies, examples, and documentation to
  connect everything together

## Migration Path

We're committed to supporting our existing monetization customers through this
transition:

1. **Continued Support**: Existing v1 monetization deployments will continue to
   function until November 15th, 2025
2. **Migration Assistance**: Our team will help you migrate to another supported
   platform
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for migrating from v1 to the new
   approach
4. **Priority Support**: Customers currently using v1 monetization will receive
   priority support for migration

## Benefits of the New Approach

### Greater Flexibility

Choose the monetization platform that best fits your needs, whether it's
Amberflo, Moesif, Polar, tripe Billing, or another solution.

### Faster Innovation

Leverage specialized platforms that are constantly improving their monetization
features.

### Better Customer Experience

Provide your customers with professional billing portals, advanced analytics,
and self-service capabilities.

### Reduced Complexity

Let billing experts handle the complexities of payments, taxes, and compliance
while you focus on your API.

## Next Steps

- **Contact Support**: If you're currently using v1 monetization and need
  assistance with migration, please reach out to our support team at
  support@zuplo.com.

## Conclusion

This change represents our commitment to providing you with the best possible
tools for API management and monetization. By partnering with specialized
monetization platforms, we can offer you more features, greater flexibility, and
a better overall experience than we could by building everything ourselves.

We're excited about this new direction and the possibilities it opens up for
your API monetization strategies. Thank you for your continued trust in Zuplo as
your API management platform.
