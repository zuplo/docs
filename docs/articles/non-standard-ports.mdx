Zuplo supports making requests to non-standard ports when your runtime is
configured with a
[compatibility date](../programmable-api/compatibility-dates.mdx) of
[2024-09-02](../programmable-api/compatibility-dates.md#2024-09-02) or later.

## Making a Request to a Non-Supported Port

Making requests to non-standard ports can be done using the built in handlers or
`fetch` API. Simply set the URL to use the port, for example
`http://example.com:8080`.

```ts
const response = await fetch("http://example.com:8080");
```

## Older Compatibility Dates

Before [2024-09-02](../programmable-api/compatibility-dates.md#2024-09-02),
Zuplo didn't support making requests to non-standard ports. If you make a
request to a non-standard port on an older runtime, the port will be ignored.
