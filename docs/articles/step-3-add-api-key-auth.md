title: Step 3 - API Key Authentication
sidebar_label: "Step 3 - API Key Auth"
---

In this guide we'll add API Key authentication to a route. You can do this for
any Zuplo project but will need a route, consider completing
[Step 1](./step-1-setup-basic-gateway.md) first.

API Key authentication is one of our most popular **policies** as implementing
this authentication method is considered one of the easiest to use by developers
but hard for API developers to get right. We also support JWT tokens and other
authentication methods.

:::info What's a Policy?

Policies are modules that can intercept and transform an incoming request or
outgoing response. You can learn more about policies [here](./policies.md).
Zuplo offers a wide range of policies built-in (including rate limiting) to save
you time. You can find the full list [here](../../policies/index.md)

:::

## 1/ Add the API Key Authentication Policy

Navigate to your route in the **Route Designer** (**Code** > `routes.oas.json`)
and open the **Policies** section. Then click **Add Policy**.

![Add Policy](../../public/media/step-3-add-api-key-auth/image.png)

Search for the API key authentication policy, click on it, and then click OK to
accept the default policy JSON.

:::tip

The API key authentication policy should usually be one of the first policies
executed. If you came here from [Step 2](./step-2-add-rate-limiting.md) then you
will want to drag it above the rate limiting policy.

If you test your route, you should get a 401 Unauthorized response

```json
{
  "status": 401,
  "title": "Unauthorized",
  "type": "https://httpproblems.com/http-status/401"
}
```

## 2/ Set up an API Key

In order to call your API, you need to configure an API consumer. Go to
**Services**, then click "Configure" on the "API Key Service".

![API Key Service](../../public/media/step-3-add-api-key-auth/image-2.png)

Then click **Create Consumer**.

![Create Consumer](../../public/media/step-2-add-api-key-auth/image-8.png)

Let's break down the configuration needed.

- Subject: Also known as `sub`. This is a unique identifier of the API consumer.
  This is commonly the name of the user or organization consuming your API
- Key managers: The email addresses of those who will be managing this API key.
- Metadata: JSON metadata that will be made available to the runtime when a key
  is used to authenticate. Common properties include the consumer's subscription
  plan, organization, etc.

Go ahead and fill in `test-consumer` for the Subject. Add your own email as a
Key manager, and leave the metadata empty for now. Click 'Save consumer' once
you're done.

## 3/ Copy your API Key

After your API Key consumer is created, click the copy button (next to the eye
icon) to copy your new API Key.

## 4/ Test out your API Key

Navigate back to the **Route Designer**, and select your route. Next to the path
of your route, click the **Test** button and fire off a request.

![Failed unauthorized error](../../public/media/step-3-add-api-key-auth/image-5.png)

You should get a 401 Unauthorized response - as we haven't supplied the API key
yet. Add an new `authorization` header with the value `Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>`
and insert the API Key you got from the developer portal.

You should now get a 200 OK.

:::note

We also offer an API for our API key service that allows you to programmatically
create consumers and even create your own developer portal or integrate key
management into your existing dashboard. See
[this document for details](./api-key-api.md).

## 5/ View your API Documentation

Whenever you deploy a new endpoint on Zuplo, it will automatically be added to
your [autogenerated developer documentation portal](./developer-portal.md).

To access your API's developer portal, click the "Gateway deployed" button in
your toolbar and click on the link under Developer Portal.
![Developer portal menu](../../public/media/step-2-add-rate-limiting/image-5.png)

When you use certain policies like API keys, Zuplo will document properties like
headers associated with that policy. As you can see on the right, the API key
policy's `Authorization` header has been documented for you.

![Developer Portal Endpoint](../../public/media/step-3-add-api-key-auth/image-7.png)

Additionally, a new Authentication section has been added to your developer
portal. Users of your API can sign in, view & manage their API keys, test your
endpoints, track API usage, and much more! You can learn more about that
[here](./dev-portal-auth.md).
