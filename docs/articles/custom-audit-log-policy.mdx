title: Custom Audit Logging Policy
sidebar_label: Audit Logging

This guide explains how to add custom audit logging beyond the scope of the
`AuditLogsInboundPolicy`.

Audit logging is an important part of API security that plays a critical role in
detecting and correcting issues such as unauthorized access or permission
elevations within your system. Audit logging is also a requirement for many
compliance certifications as well as part of the buying criteria for larger
enterprises.

Adding Audit Logging to your APIs that are secured with Zuplo is as easy as
adding a custom policy. Typically you want to add audit logs to any API that
modifies data, however depending on the API you may want it on read operations
as well (for example retrieve a secret key, etc.)

## Example Policy: WorkOS Audit Logs

[WorkOS](https://workos.com/) provides various services that help enable
enterprise features on your service such as SSO and Audit Logs. With Zuplo it's
easy to create a [custom policy](../policies/custom-code-inbound.mdx) that uses
[runtime hooks](../programmable-api/runtime-extensions.mdx) to log API calls
using their API.

```ts
import { ZuploContext, ZuploRequest, environment } from "@zuplo/runtime";

export async function auditLogPlugin(
  request: ZuploRequest,
  context: ZuploContext,
  policyName: string,
) {
  // Clone the request so the body can be read in the hook
  // note: remove this is you don't need content from the body
  const cloned = request.clone();
  context.addResponseSendingFinalHook(async (response) => {
    const incomingBody = await cloned.json();
    // This is an example event. Extract any additional data needed from the
    // request.
    const body = {
      organization_id: "org_01EHWNCE74X7JSDV0X3SZ3KJNY",
      event: {
        action: "user.signed_in",
        occurred_at: "2022-09-02T16:35:39.317Z",
        version: 1,
        actor: {
          type: "user",
          // Add the use the user sub for authenticated users
          id: request.user.sub,
          metadata: {
            role: "user",
          },
        },
        targets: [
          {
            type: "user",
            id: "user_98432YHF",
            name: "Jon Smith",
          },
          {
            type: "team",
            id: "team_J8YASKA2",
            metadata: {
              owner: "user_01GBTCQ2",
            },
          },
        ],
        context: {
          location: request.headers.get("True-Client-IP"),
          user_agent: request.headers.get("User-Agent"),
        },
        metadata: {
          extra: incomingBody.extra,
        },
      },
    };
    await fetch("https://api.workos.com/audit_logs/events", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify(body),
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${environment.WORKOS_API_KEY}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        // Optional idempotency key.
        // See: https://workos.com/docs/reference/idempotency
        // "Idempotency-Key": "YOUR_KEY_HERE"
      },
    });
  });

  return request;
}
```
