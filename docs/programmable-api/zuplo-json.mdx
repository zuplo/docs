title: Zuplo Project Config (zuplo.jsonc)
sidebar_label: Project Config
---

Certain project-level settings can be configured using the `zuplo.jsonc` file at
the root of a project. The `zuplo.jsonc` file is created by default for new
projects and contains the default configuration.

The default `zuplo.jsonc` file is shown below. The only current valid `version`
of the file is `1`.

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "compatibilityDate": "2025-02-06",
  "projectType": "managed-edge",
}
```

:::warning

The `zuplo.jsonc` file isn't currently shown or editable in the Zuplo portal.
Connect your project to source control and edit inside your source control
provider or by pushing a local change with git. If your project doesn't have a
`zuplo.jsonc` it can be added using source control

:::

## `compatibilityDate`

The `compatibilityDate` field in the `zuplo.jsonc` file allows you to lock in
the behavior of the runtime environment for your project. This is useful if you
want to ensure that your project continues to build, deploy and operate as you
expect it to.

Refer to the [documentation](./compatibility-dates.mdx) for compatibility dates
and their changes.

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "compatibilityDate": "2025-02-06",
}
```

## `projectType`

The `projectType` field in the `zuplo.jsonc` file allows you to specify the type
of your project. This value should be set to match the
[hosting environment](../articles/hosting-options.mdx) the project will be
deployed. This configuration defaults to `managed-edge`.

- `managed-edge`: (default) Projects that are deployed to Zuplo's managed edge
  environment.
- `managed-dedicated`: Projects that are deployed to your managed dedicated
  environment.
- `self-hosted`: Projects that are deployed to your own infrastructure.

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "projectType": "managed-edge",
}
```

## `allowDuplicateRoutes`

Allow duplicate routes (same method and path) to be defined. This is not
recommended as it can lead to unexpected behavior. This configuration defaults
to `false`.

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "allowDuplicateRoutes": true,
}
```

## `allowHostHeaderOverride`

Allow the Host header to be overridden by the client. This configuration
defaults to `false`. This is only supported in managed dedicated environments.
Only enable this setting if you understand the implications.

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "allowHostHeaderOverride": true,
}
```
