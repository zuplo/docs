  Instruction for disabling the legacy developer portal in your Zuplo project.
---

If you are not using the legacy developer portal, you can disable it in your
Zuplo project by making a few quick changes.

To complete these steps you can use either the Zuplo Portal or local
development.

<Stepper>

1. Delete the `./config/dev-portal.json` file from your project. This file
   configures the legacy developer portal and removing it will disable the
   portal.

2. Delete the contents of the `./docs` directory. This directory contains the
   static content for the legacy developer portal.

</Stepper>

With these files deleted, your Zuplo project will no longer include the legacy
developer portal.
