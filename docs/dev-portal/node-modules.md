title: Node Modules
---

The Dev Portal supports installing and using custom node modules in your
documentation. This allows you to extend your documentation with custom React
components, utilities, or any other npm packages.

## Installing Custom Packages

Inside your project's `/docs` directory, you can install any npm package using
the standard npm commands:

```bash
npm install your-package-name
```

## Using Custom React Components

You can import and use custom React components directly in the
`zudoku.config.tsx` file or your MDX files:

```jsx
import { MyCustomComponent } from "your-package-name";

<MyCustomComponent />;
```

## TypeScript Support

The Dev Portal includes full TypeScript support for your custom components. Make
sure your `tsconfig.json` includes the appropriate type definitions for your
packages.

## Limitations

While you can use most npm packages, be mindful of:

- Package size impact on build time
- Browser compatibility for client-side components
- Node.js-specific packages (like `fs` or `path`) cannot be used in
  `zudoku.config.tsx` since it runs in both server and browser environments -
  use environment-agnostic code only
