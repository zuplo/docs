At Zuplo we believe every API should have beautiful and powerful API
documentation. The new Developer Portal is what is powering this documentation
site and is now available as a beta for anyone to try.

## What is the Dev Portal?

The Developer Portal is a powerful tool that allows you to create and manage
beautiful API documentation. It is built on top of the Zuplo platform and
provides a seamless experience for developers to consume your APIs.

## Why the new Dev Portal?

The new Developer Portal is rewritten from the ground up to provide a more
customizable experience. It is easy to use out of the box, but also allows for
advanced customization for those who want to take it to the next level. The new
Developer Portal is built on top of Zudoku, which is a powerful static site
generator that allows for advanced customization and theming. Zudoku is build on
Vite which allows for fast builds and a great developer experience.

## What Features are available?

The new Developer Portal is packed with features that make it easy to create and
manage your API documentation. Some of the key features include:

- **Markdown Documenation**: Write your documentation in Markdown and have it
  automatically converted to HTML.
- **API Documentation**: Automatically generate API documentation from your
  OpenAPI specifications.
- **API Explorer**: Explore and test your API directly from the documentation.
- **Custom Pages**: Create custom pages for your documentation using Markdown,
  MDX, or even React.
- **Custom Modules**: Install custom modules to extend the functionality of your
  documentation.
- **API Key Management**: When using Zuplo's API Key management, you can manage
  your API keys directly from the documentation. (Coming soon)
- **Build-in Analytics**: End users can see how they are using the API, monitor
  usage of their API keys, and more right from inside the portal. (Coming soon)
