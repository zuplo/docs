title: Handlers
---

Handlers are the core of the Zuplo API gateway. Handlers are responsible for streaming a response from your downstream API or a place where you can write custom code for any scenario.

Handlers are in the middle of the request lifecycle of Zuplo between inbound and outbound [policies](/docs/policies).

Zuplo comes with several built-in handlers as well as the ability to write your own with a custom module.
