sidebar_label: Overview
---

Zuplo Managed Dedicated is a deployment model where Zuplo runs one or more
instances of the Zuplo platform on the hosting provider of your choice. This
deployment model is ideal for organizations that require custom networking
configurations or have strict security or compliance requirements.

Managed Dedicated hosting might be the right choice for you if you need:

- To run your API Gateway on the cloud provider of your choice
- To customize networking configurations, such as restricting access to the
  public internet
- Have geographical deployment requirements where the
  [Managed Edge](../articles/hosting-options.mdx#1-managed-edge) hosting option
  isn't feasible
- Have regulatory or compliance requirements that necessitate a dedicated
  instance of Zuplo
- To meet data sovereignty requirements by choosing specific regions for your
  service hosting

## Cloud Providers

Zuplo Managed Dedicated can be deployed on a wide range of cloud providers and
hosting platforms, including:

- **Akamai Connected Cloud** - Leverage Akamai's global network infrastructure
- **AWS** - Deploy to Amazon Web Services with full VPC integration
- **Azure** - Run on Microsoft Azure with private networking support
- **GCP** - Deploy to Google Cloud Platform with custom networking
- **Equinix** - Use Equinix data centers for colocation and connectivity

You can choose the regions where you want your service hosted to meet any
sovereignty or data residency concerns.

## Features

The managed dedicated hosting model provides the same core features as other
Zuplo deployment models. You can use all the same policies, integrations, and
features as you would with edge-based deployments.

### Networking and Security

  accessible from specific VPCs or IP ranges

  Link, and GCP Private Service Connect for both inbound and outbound
  connections
- **Isolated VPC Deployment** - Your gateway runs in a dedicated, isolated VPC
  for maximum security and isolation
- **Custom Ingress Options** - Use your own static IP addresses or security
  appliances (WAFs, IDS/IPS) in front of your API Gateway

### High Availability

- **Multi-Region Deployment** - Deploy multiple dedicated instances across
  multiple regions for high availability and disaster recovery
- **Automatic Failover** - Configure automatic failover between regions
- **Custom Availability Zones** - Choose specific availability zones to meet
  your redundancy requirements

### Control and Compliance

- **Dedicated Instance** - Your own isolated instance of Zuplo, ensuring no
  resource sharing with other customers
- **Full Feature Parity** - Access to all Zuplo policies, integrations, and
  features
- **Compliance Support** - Meet regulatory and compliance requirements that
  necessitate dedicated infrastructure
