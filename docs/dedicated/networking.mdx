Your dedicated managed instance of Zuplo will be deployed to the cloud provider
of your choice. Network connectivity can be customized to meet your specific
requirements.

Common configurations include:

- Using Zuplo as the public ingress to your API and using network connectivity
  such as AWS Transit Gateway, PrivateLink, or VPC Peering to connect to your
  backend services.
- Restricting access to the public internet by configuring your API Gateway to
  only accept traffic from specific IP ranges or VPCs allowing you to put WAFs,
  IDS/IPS, or other security appliances in front of your API Gateway.
- Multiple dedicated managed instances of Zuplo can be deployed across multiple
  regions to provide high availability and disaster recovery.

To discuss your networking requirements, please contact your account manager.

## Zuplo Ingress to Customer VPC

The default setup for dedicated managed Zuplo is to use your Zuplo API Gateway
as the public ingress to your API. This is the simplest setup and allows Zuplo
to manage things like SSL certificates on your behalf.

In this setup your VPC isn't exposed to the public internet at all. Instead,
your Zuplo API Gateway will use a network connection such as AWS Transit
Gateway, PrivateLink, or VPC Peering to connect to your backend services.

## Customer VPC Ingress to Zuplo API Gateway

If you have custom networking requirements, such as using a static IP address
you already own, or if you want to run services such as WAFs, IDS/IPS, or other
security products in front of your API Gateway, Zuplo can be configured to
accept traffic from your VPC then route it to your backend. Your backend could
be in the same VPC as your ingress or in another VPC.
