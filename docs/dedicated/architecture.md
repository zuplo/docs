Zuplo's managed dedicated instances are designed to be highly available,
scalable, and secure. With a managed dedicated instance of Zuplo, your API
Gateway is isolated to its own instance(s) and when running in on a cloud
provider that supports it, a dedicated VPC as well. This document outlines the
components and architecture of a managed dedicated instance of a Zuplo API
Gateway.

## Components

A managed dedicated instance of Zuplo consists of the following components:

- **API Gateway**: The API Gateway is the core component of Zuplo. It is the
  component that receives incoming requests, routes them to the appropriate
  backend, and returns the response to the client. The API Gateway is
  responsible for authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and other
  features.
- **Gateway Services**: Because Zuplo is a highly distributed API Gateway,
  services are used to facilitate features such as
  [Rate Limiting](../articles/rate-limiting.md),
  [API Key Authentication](../articles/api-key-management.md), and
  [Monetization](../articles/monetization.md).
- **Control Plane**: The Control Plane is the component that manages the
  configuration of the API Gateway. It is responsible for deploying new
  configurations, managing the lifecycle of the API Gateway, and monitoring the
  health of the API Gateway.
- **Analytics and Logging**: Zuplo can provide analytics and logging for your
  API Gateway. This includes request/response logging, error logging, and
  analytics on request volume, latency, and other metrics.
- **Developer Portal**: The Developer Portal is a web-based interface that
  allows developers to interact with your API. It provides documentation,
  testing tools, and other features to help developers integrate with your API.

## Custom Requirements

A managed dedicated instance of Zuplo can be customized to meet your specific
requirements. Examples of custom requirements include:

- **Regions & Availibility Zones** - Zuplo can deploy to multiple regions,
  availability zones, or data centers to provide high availability and low
  latency.
- **Developer Portal Hosting** - The developer portal is typically hosted from a
  CDN managed by Zuplo. Our default configuration serves the developer portal's
  static assest from a global CDN, but we can configure your developer portal to
  use only regional CDN locations if required.
- **Networking** - Zuplo can be deployed with a variety of network
  configurations. To learn more see [Networking](./networking.md).
- **Disabling Features** - Zuplo can disable features that are not needed for
  your use case or that don't meet your security or compliance requirements. For
  example, if you don't want to use the built-in API analytics and instead want
  to use your own analytics, we can disable the built-in analytics. When our
  built-in analytics is disabled, we do not collect or store analytics data for
  your APIs.
- **Custom Logging & Monitoring** - Zuplo can integrate with your existing
  logging and monitoring systems. Logs and other data are sent directly from the
  API Gateway to your logging provider. Zuplo does not collect or store this
  data.

## Security

Security is a top priority for Zuplo. A managed dedicated instance of Zuplo is
isolated from other customers and is designed to be secure by default. Some of
the security features of a managed dedicated instance of Zuplo include:

- **Isolation**: Each dedicated managed instance of Zuplo runs on its own VPC or
  network. This provides isolation from other customers and ensures that your
  data is secure.
- **Encryption**: Zuplo encrypts data in transit and at rest. All data sent to
  or from the API Gateway is encrypted using TLS. Data stored by Zuplo is
  encrypted at rest.
- **Access Control**: Zuplo provides robust authentication and access control
  mechanisms. You can control who has access to your API Gateway management
  capabilities, what they can do, and what data they can access.
- **Audit Logs**: Zuplo can provide detailed audit logs of all management
  operations. You can see who did what, when they did it, and what data they
  accessed. Additionally, Zuplo maintains internal audit logs of all activity
  performed by the Zuplo team.

## Architecture

The architecture of a managed dedicated instance of Zuplo is designed to provide
you will all the benefits of a SaaS platform, while also giving you the control
and isolation of a dedicated instance. The architecture is designed to be highly
available, scalable, and secure.

The following diagram shows the high-level architecture of a managed dedicated
instance of Zuplo.

### Deployments

When you deploy to your managed dedicated instance of Zuplo, your source code
and configuration files are uploaded to the Control Plane. The Control Plane
then deploys your API Gateway to the appropriate infrastructure. The API Gateway
is deployed to multiple nodes in multiple regions to provide high availability
and low latency. If you are running in multiple regions, the Control Plane
manages the deployment to each region without any downtime.

If you are using Zuplo's Developer Portal, the control plane also deploys the
web application that powers the Developer Portal. The Developer Portal is hosted
on a CDN to provide low latency access to end-users. The CDN configuration can
be customized to meet your specific requirements.

### Multiple Regions

It is common practice to deploy your API Gateway to multiple regions to provide
higher availible, lower latency, and to meet regulatory requirements. Zuplo can
deploy your API Gateway to multiple regions and manage the deployment to each
region without any downtime.

When your API Gateway is deployed to multiple regions, Zuplo uses a global load
balancer to route traffic to the closest region. This provides low latency
access to your APIs for end-users around the world. The load balancer is also
configured to handle failover in case of an outage in one region.

### Environments

Customers running managed dedicated Zuplo typically have multiple instances of
Zuplo deployed. The most common case is to have a production instance(s) and a
non-production instance. The non-production instance is used to deploy and test
changes to your API Gateway before deploying them to production.

Each instance is isolated and runs in its own VPC or network.

It is possible to have multiple instances depending on your requirements. For
example, some customers have seperate instances for production, staging, and
development. For most customer though, a single production and a single
development instance is sufficient.

When you onboard to Zuplo, you will work with your account manager to determine
the configuration that best meets your requirements. When your project is
created it will be pre-configured with the agreed upon number of instances and
setup with rules that determine where each environment gets deployed.

The most common setup is where your `main` branch is deployed to production and
all other branches are deployed to a non-production environment, but this is
fully customizable.
