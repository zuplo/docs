Zuplo includes policies for any solution you need for securing and sharing your
API. See the [policy introduction](../articles/policies.mdx) to learn about
using policies.

In addition to the built-in policies, Zuplo is
[fully programmable](./custom-code-inbound.mdx) so developers can simply write
code to customize any aspect of Zuplo.
