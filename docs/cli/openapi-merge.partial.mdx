## Common use cases

### Importing an existing OpenAPI file

The command supports importing both JSON and YAML formats. The format is
inferred from the file extension.

```bash
zuplo openapi merge --source /path/to/openapi.json
zuplo openapi merge --source /path/to/openapi.yaml
```

When no `--destination` option is provided, the OpenAPI file is automatically
merged into `routes.oas.json`.

To import a remote file, use the `--source` option with a URL. The command
downloads the file to a temporary directory and imports it.

```bash
zuplo openapi merge --source https://example.com/path/to/openapi.json
```

To rename the destination file, use the `--destination` option.

```bash
zuplo openapi merge --source https://example.com/path/to/openapi.json --destination new-name
```
