title: Authentication

:::tip

The API key is scoped to your account. So you can use the same one for all
projects under the same account. If you are a member of multiple accounts, be
sure to select the right one.

:::

The Zuplo CLI uses API Keys to authenticate. You can find your API Key by
following these steps:

1. Navigate to [portal.zuplo.com](https://portal.zuplo.com) and log in.
2. Select the account that you want to work on.
3. Click the **Settings** tab and navigate to the "API Keys" section. Select an
   existing API Key or create a new one to use with the CLI.

Most commands take an `--api-key` argument. For example, to list your available
Zuplo API Gateways, run:

```bash
zuplo list --api-key zpka_d67b7e241bb948758f415b79aa8exxxx_2efbxxxx
```

If you don't wish to pass your API Key to every command, you can set it as an
environment variable:

```bash
export ZUPLO_API_KEY=zpka_d67b7e241bb948758f415b79aa8exxxx_2efbxxxx
zuplo list --api-key
```
