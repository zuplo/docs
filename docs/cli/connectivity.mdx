The Zuplo CLI is used for local development as well as performing various
lifecycle operations with your Zuplo Project. This document describes the
various domain names that the CLI uses.

In order to use local development and manage your Zuplo project, you must ensure
that your network allows access to the following domains:

- `dev.zuplo.com` - This is Zuplo's public API. It's used for various
  operations, such as creating a new project, deploying a project, etc.
- `storage.zuploedge.com` - This domain is used when uploading your project
  assets when deploying your project.

In addition to the above, the following domains are used for local development:

- `*.zuploedge.com` - There are multiple services running on this domain that
  are used by local development. In order to use features like API Key
  management, rate limiting, etc. this domain must be accessible. If you must
  allow specific domains, you can use the following list. Do note, the list
  isn't exhaustive and may change over time:
  - `api.zuploedge.com`
  - `rate-limiter.zuploedge.com`
  - `redis-proxy.zuploedge.com`
  - `ellie.zuploedge.com`
  - `metrics.zuploedge.com`
  - `apikey.zuploedge.com`

## Analytics

To help improve the CLI, Zuplo collects usage and error analytics from the CLI.

If you don't wish to send analytics to Zuplo, you can set the
`ZUPLO_DO_NOT_TRACK` environment variable on your machine before invoking the
Zuplo CLI.
