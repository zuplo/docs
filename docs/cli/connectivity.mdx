The Zuplo CLI is used for local development as well as performing various
lifecycle operations with your Zuplo Project. This document describes the
various domain names that the CLI uses.

In order to use local development and manage your Zuplo project, you must ensure
that your network allows access to the following domains:

- `dev.zuplo.com` - This is Zuplo's public API. It is used for various
  operations, such as creating a new project, deploying a project, and so on.
- `storage.zuploedge.com` - This domain is used when uploading your project
  assets when deploying your project.

In addition to the above, the following domains are used for local development:

- `*.zuploedge.com` - There are muliple services running on this domain that are
  used by local development. In order to use features like API Key management,
  rate limiting, etc. this domain must be accessible. If you must allow specific
  domains, you can use the following list. Do note, the list is not exhaustive
  and may change over time:
  - `api.zuploedge.com`
  - `rate-limiter.zuploedge.com`
  - `redis-proxy.zuploedge.com`
  - `ellie.zuploedge.com`
  - `metrics.zuploedge.com`
  - `apikey.zuploedge.com`
