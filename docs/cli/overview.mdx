The Zuplo CLI provides convenient tooling for common tasks that you might want
to automate. You can use it to deploy Zuplo projects through CI/CD, create and
update environment variables, manage your tunnels, and more! It's powered by the
[Zuplo Developer API](https://dev.zuplo.com/docs), which you can also call
directly, if you want to create your own tooling.

## Installing

The Zuplo CLI is built using Node.js. It requires a minimum version of Node.js
20.0.0 (Node.js 22 is recommended).

1. Install Node.js 20.0.0 or later. You can download it from
   [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
1. Install the Zuplo CLI globally by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install -g zuplo
   ```

1. After installing the CLI, you can use the `zuplo` command to interact with
   Zuplo.
