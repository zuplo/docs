title: Zuplo CLI
---

The Zuplo CLI provides convenient tooling for common tasks that you might want
to automate. You can use it to deploy Zuplo projects through CI/CD, create and
update environment variables, manage your tunnels, and more! It's powered by the
[Zuplo Developer API](https://dev.zuplo.com/docs), which you can also call
directly, if you want to create your own tooling.
