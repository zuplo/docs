title: Zuplo CLI
---

The Zuplo CLI, `zup`, provides convenient tooling for common tasks that you
might want to automate. You can use it to deploy zups through CI/CD, create and
update environment variables, manage your tunnels, and more! It is powered by
the [Zuplo Developer API](https://dev.zuplo.com/docs), which you can also call
directly, if you want to create your own tooling.
