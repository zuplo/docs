Zuplo maintains a variety of sample APIs that are all built with Zuplo. These
are free for anyone to use for testing or demos.

## Echo API

The echo API will accept any request and will return a JSON object with details
of that request. This API accepts all HTTP methods and any body content.

URL: https://echo.zuplo.io

**Request**

```txt
POST https://echo.zuplo.io/my/path
content-type: application/json

{
  "hello": "world"
}
```

**Response**

```json

  "url": "https://echo.zuplo.io/my/path",
  "method": "POST",
  "query": {},
  "body": {

  },
