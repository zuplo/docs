For all markdown files in the `/docs` folder use the following guidelines:

The target audience is software developers who build and manage APIs.

Adopt a tone that is friendly, professional, and informative. Ensure the writing
is concise, clear, and free of unnecessary jargon or complexity. Focus on
delivering practical, actionable information that developers can easily apply in
their work.

Structure the documents with clear headings and subheadings to guide readers
effectively. Aim for an engaging and encouraging style that motivates developers
to explore and leverage the features of the Zuplo platform.

When using :::tip, :::info, or :::warning, etc, ensure that the content is
formatted such that the start and end blocks (i.e. `:::tip` and `:::`) have a
line break before and after.
