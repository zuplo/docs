Zuplo isn't your average gateway. It's a **programmable gateway** that can be used to protect and share your own API _and_ used as a simple orchestration layer over SaaS APIs. Choose your getting started guide:

1. [Proxy a public API](getting-started)
2. **Hello World API**
3. [Gateway over AirTable](getting-started-airtable)
4. [Gateway over MongoDB](getting-started-mongo-db)

## Hello World API

Because Zuplo is programmable you can easily use it to create an API - with built-in gateway features - that can be deployed to the edge. 

## 1

Open your **routes.json** file. You'll see you already have a route with a path `/v1/hello-world` configured.

## 2

Notice how the Request Handler is set to **Function** - and configured to use the `default` export of the `hello-world` module. To see the module you can click on that link. This should open the `hello-world.ts` file in your modules folder.

## 3

You'll see the file contains a function that returns `"What zup?"` (that's how we say "Hello World" at Zuplo). Change this code to return anything you like, maybe actually "Hello world!"

```
import { ZuploContext, ZuploRequest } from "@zuplo/runtime";

export default async function (request: ZuploRequest, context: ZuploContext) {

    context.log.info(`Hi, from inside your zup!`);
    return "Hello World?";
}
```

Make sure to press Save - **note** âŒ˜+S or CTRL+S works, depending on your OS.

## 4

Invoke your API using the Test Console. Click on the lightning tab and select the `hello-world.json` file. It should already have the correct Path configured for you `/v1/hello-world`. Hit the Test button to invoke your API!

Notice how you can see your response in the body. Also notice how you can see the 'Hi, from inside your zup' log entry below the body. 

## Congratulations
Your API is now live btw - you can see the URL in settings. Why not try getting that "Hello World" response from your browser.
