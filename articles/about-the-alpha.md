title: About the Alpha
---

Welcome to the Alpha version of Zuplo, we hope you enjoy using the product and
are willing to share your feedback with us - you can do so via e-mail
(whatzup@zuplo.com) or on our Discord channel
([https://discord.com/invite/CEZrnZN897](https://discord.com/invite/CEZrnZN897)).

We have a number of customers in production with Zuplo already, serving billions
of requests every month. If youâ€™re interested in going to production reach out
to josh@zuplo.com and we can set you up with a
[production workflow](/guides/production-workflow).

You cannot go to production using the alpha portal just yet, but that is coming
soon.

Enjoy!
