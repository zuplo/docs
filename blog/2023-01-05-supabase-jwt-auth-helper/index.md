We've recently been playing with [Supabase](supabase.com) a lot and showing how Zuplo can [help you take your Supabase backend and go "API-first"](https://zuplo.com/blog/2022/11/18/shipping-a-public-api-backed-by-supabase).

Often times, this requires you to have a JWT token from Supabase for testing. Since we're very focused on the API and backend of your infrastructure I got tired of creating test websites to login to Supabase and get myself a valid JWT. For that reason, we created a free online tool to help you get a JWT token from supabase for testing.

- [supabasejwt.com](https://supabasejwt.com) - because sometimes you just want to get a JWT token.

It's easy to use and the instructions are on the homepage. Also, check out this short video for a quick guide:

It's open source too - contribute on [github](https://github.com/zuplo/supabase-jwt)
