Today we're excited to announce one of the first cool features resulting from
Zuplo's bet on the OpenAPI standard: rapid mocking of APIs using examples inside
an OpenAPI document - it's just what every

Sometimes it's better to show than tell, so in that spirit, check out the 2
minute video below that shows you the end-to-end experience.

With this powerful new capability, developers can effortlessly generate mock
endpoints that mimic the behavior of real APIs, speeding up development cycles
and enabling more efficient testing. Combined with our `sleep` policy you can
even mix in some latency for added realism - just what every mockstar frontend
developer needs!

## Walkthrough

To get started, create a new project in Zuplo at
[portal.zuplo.com](https://portal.zuplo.com) (or use an existing project if you
have one). Hopefully you have an OpenAPI document (or
[you can get ChatGPT to generate one for you](https://youtu.be/8zAuE2OUQLE))
with some juicy examples in it - I'm going to use the
[Postman OpenAPI](https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/getpostman.com/1.20.0/openapi.json)
doc from [apis.guru](https://apis.guru).

Let's import your OpenAPI doc.
