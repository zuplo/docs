At Zuplo, our mission is to revolutionize API management by modernizing and
democratizing the API Gateway. We have made significant progress in achieving
this goal by focusing on two key objectives:

- making API gateway adoption effortless
- reducing the cost associated with its purchase and management

Historically, smaller businesses have avoided advanced API Gateway tools due to
their complexity and high costs. However, Zuplo has successfully addressed these
challenges, making our gateway incredibly easy to learn, adopt, and manage. By
doing so, we have enabled large customers to save over 80% on the sticker price
of products like Apigee and Kong, while also providing a fully-managed solution
that includes hosting costs and eliminates the need to manage K8 clusters and
scaling.

## Introducing new Pricing for our Builder Tier

Today, we are thrilled to announce a major update to our pricing structure,
specifically for our Builder tier. Previously priced at $100 per month, the
Builder tier offered customers the ability to have a custom domainâ€”an essential
feature for most API launches. In line with our mission of reducing barriers to
entry, we are excited to reveal that we have lowered the price of our Builder
tier by 75%, making it now available for just $25 per month.

## Unbeatable Value

That really is incredible value, including

1. **Fully Managed API Key Solution**: Simplify your API management with our
   comprehensive API key solution.

2. **Extensive Out-of-the-Box Policies**: Benefit from numerous pre-configured
   policies such as JWT authentication and rate-limiting. Explore the complete
   list of policies here.

3. **Developer Portal**: Engage your developers with an intuitive developer
   portal, featuring API references and integrated self-serve API key
   management.

4. **Unlimited Deployed Environments**: Enjoy the freedom to deploy your APIs in
   multiple environments without any restrictions.

5. **Fast Deployments to Global Data Centers**: With Zuplo, your API will be
   accessible worldwide, as we offer lightning-fast deployments to 300 data
   centers across the globe.

And, what's more, you can now add additional users (up to a total of 4) for just
$25 per month/user and $25 for an additional custom domain. For customers that
need more users, domains and an SLA, our **Business** tier is still aggressively
priced at just $500 / month.
