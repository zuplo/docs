We founded Zuplo with a goal of modernizing and democratizing API management, of
reinventing the API Gateway / Management (we'll use 'API Gateway' from hereon
in). To do this we needed to achieve two key things

- Make it easy to learn and adopt an API gateway.
- Reduce the cost of purchase and management of API gateway.

Until now, most smaller businesses have eschewed API Management and advanced API
Gateway tools because they're too complex and too expensive. We've already made
huge strides here by making the gateway fantastically easy to learn, adopt and
manage. We have saved large customers over 80% on the sticker price of products
like Apigee and Kong, and even more when you consider we are fully-managed,
include hosting costs and avoid the need to manage K8 clusters and scaling.

Today we have good news for the other end of the business spectrum with an
update to our **Builder** tier pricing. Originally $100 / month, this was the
first option where you could have a custom domain - a necessity for most
customers to launch their API.

Our goal is to keep lowering the barrier to entry to use products like Zuplo so
today we're excited to announce that we dropped the price of our **Builder**
tier by 75% to just $25 / month.

That really is incredible value, including

- fully managed API key solution for your API
- tons of out of the box policies (JWT, rate-limiting, so many -
  [see here](https://zuplo.com/docs/policies))
- developer-portal with API reference and integrated self-serve API key
  management
- unlimited deployed environments
- fast deployments to one region: **Earth** - be present at the edge in 300
  data-centers worldwide

And, what's more, you can now add additional users (up to a total of 4) for just
$25 per month/user and $25 for an additional custom domain.

For customers that need more users, domains and an SLA, our **Business** tier is
still aggressively priced at just $500 / month.

Enjoy, we can't wait to see what you build. Got questions?
