We recently shared some reasoning on [why we think API keys are probably the right authentication approach for your public API](ttps://www.zuplo.com/blog/2022/05/03/you-should-be-using-api-keys).

We think this is **so** important that we built it as a feature of the Zuplo gateway. Our API Key management includes:

- secure storage and management of keys and metadata - with an admin UI and API to manage consumers.
- integrated developer portal with self-serve key management for your customers.

| Note, if you've already built your own API Key solution, and have a database store with your keys and users, we can easily integrate zuplo authentication with custom policies. It's never too late to make hosting your API much easier.
