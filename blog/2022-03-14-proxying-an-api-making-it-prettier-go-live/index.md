In this video we show you just how easy it is to proxy an API with Zuplo and add rate-limiting. We also prettify the URL of our ugly backend to make things feel a little more modern and current.

There was no code in this demo but we did do a URL rewrite as follows

`https://ecommerce-legacy.zuplo.io/objects?type=products&id=${params.productId}`
