In this video we see just how programmable the Zuplo gateway is by going _full tilt_ and building a simple API using **Function Handlers** ðŸ¤¯

We also look at wildcard routes like so `/(.*)`.

Here's the code from the echo API we create

```
import  { ZuploContext, ZuploRequest } from "@zuplo/runtime";

export default async function (request: ZuploRequest, context: ZuploContext) {
 const { url, query } = request;

 const body = await request.text();

 return { url, query, body };
}
```
