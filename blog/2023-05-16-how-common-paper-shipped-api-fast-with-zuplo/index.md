I recently had the pleasure of chatting with Ben Garvey, the co-founder and CTO
of Common Paper. Our discussion covers their innovative open-source platform for
contracts and how they are revolutionizing the way businesses handle contract
management and how they used Zuplo to accelerate the launch of their API.

## Unleashing the Power of Open Source for Contracts

In the chat ([video below](https://youtu.be/1rAxJFVXU84)) Ben explains that
Common Paper is on a mission to simplify and accelerate the contract creation
and negotiation process. Their platform offers a comprehensive range of standard
agreements that can be easily downloaded from their website. From NDAs to CSAs,
DPAs to partnership agreements, Common Paper provides a vast library of
open-source contracts. This approach draws inspiration from the world of
open-source software, where licenses like Apache 2 and GPL are readily available
for developers without the need for legal consultation.

By leveraging Common Paper's platform, startups and businesses can say goodbye
to the archaic practice of emailing Word documents back and forth during the
contract negotiation phase. Instead, the platform enables users to create,
negotiate, and sign contracts directly within the app. This streamlined workflow
not only saves time but also reduces costs, empowering sales teams to close
deals faster.

## Deploying Zuplo to focus on what matters and move fast

During our conversation, Ben highlights the benefits of Zuplo - acting as a
gateway for Common Paper's API, with essential capabilities including API
authentication, rate limiting and developer documentation. With a small team at
Common Paper, leveraging Zuplo allowed their engineers to focus on product
development, leaving the complex aspects of API management to the experts.

One interesting aspect of Common Paper's integration with Zuplo is the
generation of API keys being embedded into their own dashboard. By utilizing
Zuplo's API key service, Common Paper simplifies the process of managing and
securing their API keys.

Ben notes the excellent service he has received from the team at Zuplo and is a
particular fan of how fast Zuplo is - particularly our near instantaneous
deployment time; aligning with Common Paper's need for quick iteration and
shipping fast. The combination of Zuplo's reliable infrastructure, extensive
documentation, and responsive support made it an ideal choice for Common Paper's
API management requirements.
