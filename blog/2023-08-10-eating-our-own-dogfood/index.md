Today — Day 4 of API Key Week — we're proud to share that we are indeed eating
our own dogfood. We just updated the Developer Portal in Zuplo (which also just
received a bunch of performance upgrades💨).

This makes for an improvement on our self-serve API keys capability in the Zuplo
developer portal by making key features like **key-rolling** front and center.

Here's a video showing the new control in action on the developer portal:
