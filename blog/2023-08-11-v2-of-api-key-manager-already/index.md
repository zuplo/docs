Today — Day 5 of API Key Week — we're proving that we like to move FAST. On
Tuesday,
[we announced our open-source API key management component](https://zuplo.com/blog/2023/08/08/open-source-release):
[@zuplo/react-api-key-manager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zuplo/react-api-key-manager).

We got feedback already on some potential improvements and are today releasing
v2. Some of the improvements

- Easier provider implementation
- Improved async loading state
- Integrated create and delete consumers
- Much faster setup (see below)
- api-key-manager.com now works on mobile

To play with the new control, you can try it at
[api-key-manager.com](https://api-key-manager.com) or in the Zuplo Developer
Portal. Try the sample by following along with the
[tutorial walkthrough](https://zuplo.com/blog/2023/08/08/open-source-release).

Thanks for joining us for #apikeyweek - another themed week coming very soon.
