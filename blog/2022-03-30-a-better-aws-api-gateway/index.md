Maybe my favorite video of the series. So if you use AWS Lambda you're probably
using the AWS API Gateway. We're sorry to hear that. But fear not, there is an
alternative. A real gateway with more features than you can shake at a fresh
copy of Monkey Island that outperforms AWS API Gateway calling Lambda? It can't
be... can it?
