Welcome to OpenAPI week at Zuplo!

![Zuplo <3 OpenAPI](https://cdn.zuplo.com/assets/6843d057-a45e-49c0-a546-bb3702fd0cd1.png)

Today we're announcing our official support for OpenAPI. Unlike other gateways, we're not simply adding an **import feature** for OpenAPI but are now OpenAPI native, with the format being the core of how route configuration is specified in the gateway.

Any valid OpenAPI document is a valid API Gateway configuration for Zuplo, additional properties and configuration is added via `x-zuplo` vendor extensions.

As a result, Zuplo now offers the most seamless workflow for users of OpenAPI. For those that don't use OpenAPI, you'll be using it in Zuplo, but won't even notice. The good news is, you'll be ready to take advantage of OpenAPI at any moment.

Read more about this in our [OpenAPI docs](/docs/articles/open-api).
