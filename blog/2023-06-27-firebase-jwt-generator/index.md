In January, we launched [supbasejwt.com](https://supabasejwt.com) -
[announcement here](https://zuplo.com/blog/2023/01/05/supabase-jwt-auth-helper)
to help you quickly create JWT tokens for your Supabase backend, because, you
know - _sometimes you just really want a JWT token_.

Having quick and easy access to JWT tokens is super useful when testing your API
or using an API Gateway like Zuplo.

Today, we're announcing [firebasejwt.com](https://firebasejwt.com) - because
sometimes you just want to get a JWT token.

It's easy to use and the instructions are on the homepage. Also, check out this
video for a quick guide.
