Planning to build a new public customer or partner API but not sure where to start your research? Connect with fellow developers and nail development of your new API by joining our weekly meetup on [Discord](https://zuplo.link/3sJq0DV), "Building a Customer API".

On June 2, 2022 at 3pm ET/12pm PT we'll be joined by Utsav Shah of fast growing startup Vanta (and host of the [Software at Scale](https://www.softwareatscale.dev/) podcast). He'll share his experience building a customer API and challenges when implementing rate limiting. Then we'll have an open discussion on implementing rate limiting and exposing APIs to customers and partners.

## Building a Customer API

At 3pm ET/12pm PT every Thursday, Zuplo hosts a 1-hour round-table discussion virtually (Discord) to help developers plan for and build their public customer or partner APIs. We feature one attendee each week who has recently built a public customer or partner API and who will share how they approached the process and what they learned, then stick around to answer questions and discuss. This chat is limited to 25 spaces per week to keep the conversation flowing and fruitful. We'll start with a Q&A with the featured guest and then have an open discussion immediately following.
