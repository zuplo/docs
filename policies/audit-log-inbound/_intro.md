Audit logging is an important part of API security that plays a critical role in
detecting and correcting issues such as unauthorized access or permission
elevations within your system. Audit logging is also a requirement for many
compliance certifications as well part of the buying criteria for larger
enterprises.

Adding Audit Logging to your APIs that are secured with Zuplo is as easy as
adding a policy. Typically you want to add audit logs to any API that modifies
data, however depending on the API you may want it on read operations as well
(i.e. retrieve a secret key, etc.)
