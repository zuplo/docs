Zuplo includes policies for any solution you need for securing and sharing your
API. See the [policy introduction](/docs/policies) to learn about using
policies.

The [CORS policy](/docs/articles/custom-cors-policy) is a special type of policy
that is configured separately. Check out details in
[our CORS policy documentation](/docs/articles/custom-cors-policy).

<ItemCatalog items={policyConfig.policies.map(({ id, name, icon }) => ({ id,
name, icon, href: "/docs/policies/" + id }))} />
