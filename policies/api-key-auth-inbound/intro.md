**This policy is deprecated.** Please use the new [API Key Authentication](https://zuplo.com/docs/policies/api-key-inbound) policy instead. This policy will continue to work but will be removed in a future version of Zuplo.

This policy uses the managed API key storage provided by Zuplo. `allowUnauthenticatedRequests` defaults to false and rejects any request without a valid API key (returning a `401 - Unauthorized` response). You can override (set `"allowUnauthenticatedRequests" : true`<!-- -->) this to support multiple authentication methods or support both authenticated and anonymous requests.
