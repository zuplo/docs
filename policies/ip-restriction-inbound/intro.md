This custom policy allows you to specify a set of IP addresses that are allowed
or blocked from making requests on your API. This can be useful for adding
light-weight security to your API in non-critical scenarios. For example, if you
want to ensure only employees on your corporate VPN cannot access development
environments.

Generally, this policy should not be relied upon as the only security for
protecting sensitive workloads.
