The Open ID JWT Authentication policy allows you to authenticate incoming
requests using an Open ID-compliant bearer token. It works with any valid JWT token. Note that you can configure this to work with tokens generated by Auth0, Okta, or Cognito but we have custom policies to make those even easier.

In this example, we have a policy configured to validate an incoming JWT token
signed by a secret stored in an environment variable `AUTH_JWT_SIGNING_KEY`.

```json
{
  "export": "OpenIdJwtInboundPolicy",
  "module": "$import(@zuplo/runtime)",
  "options": {
    "allowUnauthenticatedRequests": false,
    "audience": "$env(AUTH_AUDIENCE)",
    "issuer": "$env(AUTH_ISSUER)",
    "secret": "$env(AUTH_JWT_SIGNING_KEY)"
  }
}

```

The following example shows you how you could use a JWK URL to validate your tokens - this example would work for Auth0 (though you should just use the Auth0 policy)


```json
{
  "export": "OpenIdJwtInboundPolicy",
  "module": "$import(@zuplo/runtime)",
  "options": {
    "allowUnauthenticatedRequests": false,
    "audience": "$env(AUTH_AUDIENCE)",
    "issuer": "$env(AUTH_ISSUER)",
    "jwkUrl": "https://zuplo-demo.us.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json"
  }
}
```
