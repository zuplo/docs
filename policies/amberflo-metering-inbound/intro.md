Amberflo ([amberflo.io](https://www.amberflo.io/)) is a usage metering and billing service. This policy allows you to meter API calls going through Zuplo and send them to your Amberflo account using your Amberflo API key.

Add the policy to each route you want to meter. Note you can specify the Meter API Name and Meter Value (meter increment) at the policy level.
