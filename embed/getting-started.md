# A stripe quality API in 4 steps

There are three pillars to sharing an API: authentication, protection, and documentation. Letâ€™s add all of these features to this sample e-commerce API at `[https://ecommerce-api.zuplo.io](https://ecommerce-api.zuplo.io)` in just 4 steps.

## 1. Setup your first route

Open routes.json in the file editor on the left. Change the first route **path** to `/products/:productId` and the **URL Rewrite** to `[https://ecommerce-api.zuplo.io/${params.productId}](https://ecommerce-api.zuplo.io/${params.productId})`.

## 2. Add authentication and protection

Next, weâ€™ll add two policies to this route to enforce API-key authentication and rate-limiting. Expand the **Policies** section and click **Add policy** on the request pipeline. Search for **API-Key Authentication** and add that policy.

Next search for **Rate** **Limiting** and choose that policy. Change the `rateLimitBy` property from IP to `user`. That will rate-limit requests based on the API consumer.

:::tip

Many API owners donâ€™t think they need rate limiting protection because they wonâ€™t be attacked. However, 99% of the time itâ€™s your customer that attacks you with an accidental for-loop in their code. Donâ€™t ship your API program without protection!

## 3. Setup an API Consumer

Now that your API is protected with API-Key authentication you need to create an API consumer that can generate a key. Head to the **Settings** [1] section and choose **API Key Consumers** [2]**.**

Click Add new consumer [3] and enter a name for your API key, and enter your own e-mail address as the manager (so that you can create a key to complete the demo), then click Save - you can leave the metadata blank.

## 4. Visit your developer portal to create a key

Click on the Your Dev Portal link near the top left of the portal.

![Open Portal](../static/media/embed/getting-started/open-portal.png)

Youâ€™ll see the documentation that has been automatically generated for your API ðŸŽ‰. Click the sign-in button at the top right and sign in with your e-mail address. Click the API Key tab - you should see the name of the key you set up in step 3. Click Create key to generate your API key and copy it to your clipboard... youâ€™re ready to go.

## Now test your API ðŸš€

Open the integrated **API Test Console** [1] and set the path to `/products/10000` [2]. Hit **Test** [3] to fire an unauthenticated request to your API - you should get a **401 Unauthorized** response.

Now add an `authorization` header with the format `Bearer <apikey>` [4], using the API key you copied from the developer portal - you should get a **200** ðŸŽŠ .

Finally, hit **Test** [3] a few more times to test that rate limiting âœ‹.
