# Zuplo Documentation

This repository contains the Zuplo documentation. We welcome contributions to
this content.

**Please review the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before sending a
PR or opening an issue.**

## Editing Docs Content

- You can edit Docs content by using the GitHub web editor and editing a file.
  This is best suited for typos and small changes.
- You can also pull down the `/docs` repo to your computer via Git and edit
  files in your local editor, before pushing a new branch (or a branch to your
  own fork of the project). You can then go to GitHub.com and start a PR. We
  will be able to review the changes in a Heroku test application prior to
  merging.
- Lastly, you can
  [run and test the docs site locally](https://github.com/zuplo/zuplo-www/blob/master/README.md)
  (access available to Zuplo employees only). This option is best suited for
  repeat contributors or for complex contributions. You gain the benefit of
  locally testing and viewing your changed or added pages, navigation, and
  config, but you also gain the complexity of dealing with the local docs app,
  setting it up, and keeping it updated.

Regardless of which option you use, please review any relevant sections of the
[Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before sending a PR.
